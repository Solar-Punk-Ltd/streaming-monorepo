# streaming-infra-manager

Deployment and orchestration tooling for testing the Swarm HLS live-streaming
stack. Targets two dedicated servers:

- **Streamer**: Bee light node, `stream-uploader` service, SRS.
- **Watcher**: N lightweight Docker containers running a Bee ultra-light node
  and the React streaming client, plus a small interface to start and stop them.

It also deploys the two halves of an ABR stage, which normally live on different
machines under different managers:

- **ABR Node Pool**: a deployment group with one Bee node per quality rung, as
  the publish targets. Produces the `BEE_PUBLISHERS` string.
- **ABR Uploader**: `srs` and `stream-uploader` publishing to that pool. It has
  no Bee node and no postage of its own. You paste the pool's `BEE_PUBLISHERS`
  in.

See [docs/features/abr-ladder.md](docs/features/abr-ladder.md).

## Layout

- `manager/swarm-hls-stream/`: a git submodule pointing at
  [Solar-Punk-Ltd/swarm-hls-stream](https://github.com/Solar-Punk-Ltd/swarm-hls-stream),
  tracking `main-v3`. This is the upstream application source, with the
  packages under `packages/` and the engine trees under `engines/`. The commit
  it records is the **bundled** stack version, and that version is the default
  until another is chosen. A deploy does not carry this tree. It writes the
  recorded commit into `manager/.stack-commit`, and the server fetches and
  builds that commit itself, the same way it builds any version added on the
  Versions page.
- `/opt/streaming/streaming-infra-manager-versions/` on the deploy host
  (`STACK_VERSIONS_ROOT`). Each version keeps three siblings there:
  `<name>.repo/`, the clone it builds from, `<name>.builds/<build id>/`, one
  immutable directory per published build, and `<name>/`, the settings files
  the operator owns. A build is a checkout with its packages built, so it runs
  to about a gigabyte, and more than one build of a version can be kept at
  once. The root is a sibling of the data root and sits outside the tree
  `deploy/deploy.sh` rsyncs with `--delete`, so a manager deploy cannot wipe
  it. The Versions page adds, updates, configures and removes these. See
  [docs/features/stack-versions.md](docs/features/stack-versions.md) and
  [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md).
- `/opt/streaming/streaming-infra-manager-data/<deployment>/` on the deploy
  host (`BEE_DATA_ROOT`): the deployment's Bee node data and keys, and under
  `engine/` the config file of its own when it runs on one. Survives a manager
  deploy, removed with the deployment. See
  [docs/features/engine-config.md](docs/features/engine-config.md).

## Checks

The `checks` workflow declares three jobs on every pull request and push to
`main-v2`: the build and the unit suites, the SQL suites against nine
disposable databases, and the browser suites against a real headless Chrome. A
second workflow, started by hand, runs the container-backed regressions and the
signed-in integration suite. That second one has never been dispatched. What
each job proves, what it does not, and how to run any of it on a laptop:
[docs/ci.md](docs/ci.md).

## Cloning this repository

This repo uses a **git submodule** (the `manager/swarm-hls-stream/` directory). A plain
`git clone` will leave that directory empty, which will break every later step.
Use one of the two flows below.

### Option A, clone everything in one go (recommended)

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Solar-Punk-Ltd/streaming-monorepo.git
cd streaming-infra-manager
```

The `--recurse-submodules` flag tells git to also fetch the contents of every
submodule. After this completes, `manager/swarm-hls-stream/` will be populated.

### Option B, you already cloned without the flag

If you ran a plain `git clone` and `manager/swarm-hls-stream/` is empty, run this once
inside the repo:

```sh
cd streaming-infra-manager
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

`--init` registers the submodule locally, which is needed the first time only.
`--recursive` also pulls any submodules of submodules. Re-running this is safe
at any time and does not overwrite committed work.

### How to tell it worked

```sh
ls manager/swarm-hls-stream/packages
```

That should print several package directories, `cli`, `client` and
`stream-uploader` among them. If the directory is empty, the submodule was not
fetched. Go back to Option A or B.

## Updating the upstream submodule

To pull the latest commits from the branch the submodule tracks, `main-v3`:

```sh
git submodule update --remote manager/swarm-hls-stream
git add manager/swarm-hls-stream
git commit -m "chore: bump swarm-hls-stream"
```

Give the path, `manager/swarm-hls-stream`, and not the submodule's name. The
first command moves the submodule to the tip of the tracked branch. The next
two record that move as a commit here, so every clone pins the same version,
and so does the next deploy, which writes that commit into
`manager/.stack-commit` for the server to build.
