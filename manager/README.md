# Manager API

Thin TypeScript backend that runs the `swarm-hls-stream` deploy scripts on
demand and tracks each profile's `port_slot` in PostgreSQL so two profiles
on the same host can never collide on a port.

## Stack

- **Express 5** + ESM + **TypeScript**
- **PostgreSQL 16** — single source of truth for `port_slot` allocations (1–999)
- **Yup** — request body / params validation at the API edge
- **dotenv** — config from `.env`
- **Docker-out-of-Docker** — the API container spawns `bash deploy.sh ...`,
  which calls `docker compose` against the host daemon via a mounted
  `/var/run/docker.sock`

## Quick start (one host, "localhost" deploys)

```bash
cp manager/.env.sample manager/.env
cd manager
docker compose up --build -d
curl localhost:9876/health                      # {"status":"ok"}
docker compose exec -it api node dist/cli.js user:add <username>
```

Until that last command has been run once, every route but `/health` and
`POST /auth/login` answers 401, and the sign-in page says so.

## Authentication

Every route needs a session except two: `GET /health`, which Docker's
healthcheck reads, and `POST /auth/login`. That includes both Server-Sent
Events streams, `/config`, `/metrics` and `/profiles`.

### The first user

There is no sign-up. The first user is created on the host, once:

```bash
docker compose exec -it api node dist/cli.js user:add owner
```

It asks for the password twice with nothing echoed, and writes only the hash.
Without a terminal it refuses, unless `--password-stdin` is given, which reads
the password from a pipe so a vault can supply it without the value landing in
a file or an argument:

```bash
op read "op://<vault>/<item>/password" | \
  docker compose exec -T api node dist/cli.js user:add owner --password-stdin
```

There is deliberately no environment variable and no seed file that carries a
password. A password is 12 to 128 characters and must not contain the username.
It is stored as `scrypt$N$r$p$<salt>$<key>`, so the cost parameters can be
raised later without invalidating the passwords already set.

### The session

Signing in sets `sim_session=<token>; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Path=/`, plus
`Secure` when the browser reached the manager over HTTPS and only then. That is
read from the request: `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` from the TLS edge, which
nginx forwards, or a TLS connection to the manager itself. Over the plain HTTP
of the SSH tunnel it is left off, because a browser drops a `Secure` cookie
that did not arrive over TLS and the sign-in would loop.

The token is 32 random bytes; the database stores only its SHA-256, so a dump of
the sessions table signs nobody in. A session ends after twelve hours of
inactivity, and fourteen days after it started whatever happens in between.

Signing out, revoking a user's sessions, removing a user or changing a password
also closes that session's open event streams at once, so a browser stops
receiving profile events the moment it stops being signed in. A session that
runs out rather than being revoked has its streams closed within a minute, and a
stream is not activity, so a page left open with nothing but its streams still
idles out after twelve hours.

Five wrong passwords for a username, or from one address, start a one minute
lockout that doubles per further attempt up to an hour, answered as 429 with
`Retry-After`. Every failure is logged with the username and the address.

Every request that is not a GET must carry the header
`X-Requested-With: streaming-infra-manager`, and one whose `Origin` or
`Sec-Fetch-Site` says it came from another site is refused with 403. The
manager sets no CORS headers, which is what makes that header impossible for a
cross-origin page to add.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Body | Answer |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| POST | `/auth/login` | `{ username, password }` | 204 and the cookie, 401 wrong pair, 429 locked, 409 when no user exists |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | | 204, cookie cleared, session row deleted |
| GET | `/auth/session` | | `{ username, expiresAt }`, or 401 with `not_signed_in` or `no_users` |
| POST | `/auth/password` | `{ current, next }` | 204, every other session of yours revoked |
| GET | `/auth/users` | | `[{ id, username, createdAt, lastLoginAt, sessions }]` |
| POST | `/auth/users` | `{ username, password }` | 201, 409 taken |
| DELETE | `/auth/users/:id` | | 204, 409 for yourself or the last user |
| POST | `/auth/users/:id/revoke-sessions` | | 204 |

## API

All command endpoints stream output as Server-Sent Events
(`start` / `stdout` / `stderr` / `error` / `done`). Use `curl -N` to follow.

### Profiles

| Method | Path              | Body                                              | Notes                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/profiles`       | `{ name, kind?: "streamer"\|"viewer"\|"custom" }` | Allocates lowest free `port_slot` (1–999), seeds from `.env`. |
| GET    | `/profiles`       | —                                                 | List ordered by `port_slot`.                                  |
| GET    | `/profiles/:name` | —                                                 | Single profile.                                               |
| DELETE | `/profiles/:name` | —                                                 | Releases the slot.                                            |

### Actions (per profile, SSE)

| Method | Path                     | Body                      | Maps to                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| POST   | `/profiles/:name/deploy` | `{ services?: string[] }` | `deploy.sh --profile=<name> --portSlot=<n> [services]` |
| POST   | `/profiles/:name/stop`   | `{ services?: string[] }` | `stop.sh   --profile=<name> --portSlot=<n> [services]` |
| GET    | `/profiles/:name/health` | —                         | `health.sh --profile=<name> --portSlot=<n>`            |

When `services` is omitted:

- `streamer` → `srs stream-uploader bee-uploader`
- `viewer` → `client bee-gateway`
- `custom` → empty (the script then uses everything enabled in `config.json`)

Media engines: `srs` (default) and `ome` are mutually exclusive — a profile's
`components` may contain at most one of them. Including `ome` makes the manager
write `ENGINE=ome` (plus slot-shifted `OME_SRT_PORT`/`OME_HLS_PORT`) into the
profile's `.env.<name>` so the stream-uploader runs the OvenMediaEngine plugin.

SRT passphrase: a profile may carry its own `srt_passphrase`, written to
`.env.<name>` as `SRT_PASSPHRASE` so SRS encrypts that deployment's SRT listener
with it. Left unset, the base `.env`'s host-wide value applies — the behaviour
before the field existed. SRS only; OME's SRT listener takes no passphrase.
Accepted values are 10–79 characters of `A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ ~ -`; the bounds are
libsrt's and the character set keeps the value intact through the `sed` in
`engines/srs/entrypoint.sh`, the env file, the srs.conf directive and the
`srt://…&passphrase=` publish URL (see `common/src/srtPassphrase.ts`).

### Chequebook (per profile, its own bee node)

A bee node pays the peers that forward its uploads with cheques drawn on a
chequebook, a contract on Gnosis Chain holding BZZ. It is a different pot from
the node's wallet: the wallet holds xDAI for gas and BZZ for buying stamps and
for topping the chequebook up. When the chequebook runs dry nothing looks
broken, the node stays healthy and every push stalls waiting for a payment it
cannot make.

| Method | Path                                  | Body                    | Notes                                                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/profiles/:name/chequebook`          |                         | Address, balances, settlement totals and the health verdict. Any field is `null` when that call to the node failed. |
| POST   | `/profiles/:name/chequebook/deposit`  | `{ amount }` PLUR string | Wallet to chequebook. `202 { transactionHash }`. Refused with 400 when the wallet holds less BZZ than asked or has no xDAI for gas. |
| POST   | `/profiles/:name/chequebook/withdraw` | `{ amount }` PLUR string | Chequebook to wallet. `202 { transactionHash }`. Refused with 400 above the available balance. |

`amount` is PLUR, bee's integer unit, matching `^[1-9][0-9]*$` and at most 30
digits. 1 BZZ is 10^16 PLUR, so a decimal here is refused rather than
interpreted. `common/src/chequebook.ts` converts.

Both writes answer as soon as bee has submitted the transaction, not once it is
mined, so the balance moves a few Gnosis blocks later. Poll the GET to see it.

`POST /profiles/:name/deploy-uploader` refuses with `409 chequebook_unfunded`
when the node reports less than the floor available. A node that cannot be
asked does not block the deploy, the same rule the stamp check applies: a failed
probe is no evidence about a chequebook.

**`CHEQUEBOOK_FLOOR_BZZ`** sets that floor, default `0.5`. It is a decimal BZZ
amount above zero with at most 16 decimal places, parsed once at startup, and a
malformed value stops the process rather than silently reverting to the default.
`GET /config` answers it as `chequebookFloorBzz` so the UI shows the number the
gate uses.

### Engine control

The media server of one deployment: what it is configured with, and the two
things an operator does to it by hand.

| Method | Path | Body | Answer |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| GET | `/profiles/:name/engine` | none | `{ engine, abr, settings, defaults, fields, live, liveUnavailableReason, notInConfig }` |
| PUT | `/profiles/:name/engine-settings` | `{ HLS_FRAGMENT?, HLS_WINDOW?, ABR_*? }` | 202 and the profile. Recreates the engine container only |
| POST | `/profiles/:name/containers/:service/restart` | none | 202. `srs`, `ome`, `stream-uploader` and `bee-uploader` only |
| GET | `/profiles/:name/containers/:service/logs?tail=200` | none | `text/plain`, at most 2000 lines |
| GET | `/profiles/:name/engine/config` | none | `text/plain`, `no-store`. The config the running container generated |
| GET | `/profiles/:name/engine-config` | none | `{ engine, supported, unsupportedReason, config, template, placeholders, error, references }`, `no-store` |
| PUT | `/profiles/:name/engine-config` | `{ config }` | 202 and the profile, or 400 with the engine's own reason. Recreates the engine and watches it |
| DELETE | `/profiles/:name/engine-config` | none | 202 and the profile. Back to the version's template |

`profiles.engine_settings` is a JSONB column holding only the keys a deployment
overrides, by their env name. An absent key means the stack's own default: the
key is not written into `.env.<name>` at all, so the base `.env` still decides
it, exactly as an unset SRT passphrase does. The fields, their bounds, their
choices and the rule that frame rate times segment length must be a whole
number of frames live in `common/src/engineSettings.ts`, which the manager, the
UI and the offline mock all read. One JSONB column rather than one per setting
because the set differs per engine and per stack version, and
`migrations/009_engine_settings.sql` says so at length.

Saving settings redeploys the engine service alone, so the profile goes
`DEPLOYING` and back while the uploader and the Bee node stay up. A restart is
below that state machine: it changes no status and publishes an
`engine.restarted` activity event instead.

Live status (what is publishing right now) is not read yet. On the bundled
stack SRS's HTTP API listens on 1985 inside the container and the compose file
publishes no such port, and OvenMediaEngine's API needs a `<Managers>` block
the template does not carry. `main-v3` publishes the SRS port and the manager
does not read it yet. `GET /profiles/:name/engine` answers `live: null` with
the reason for that deployment's version in `liveUnavailableReason`.

#### A config file of the deployment's own

Everything an engine can do beyond the settings drawer is a matter of editing
its config file, and both engines are configured by file alone: SRS by
`srs.conf`, OvenMediaEngine by `Server.xml`. Neither has a configuration web
page. The Engine card's **Config file** button opens the whole file, and the
manager stores it in `profiles.engine_config` (migration 012), whole, with the
stack's `*_PLACEHOLDER` tokens kept in it. The stack fills those at container
start, so the passphrase, the ports, the webhook token and the values from the
settings drawer never sit in the stored text, and a token the file drops is a
setting the drawer marks as not read (`notInConfig`).

It works on a stack version whose contract has the hook, `engineConfig` in
`GET /versions`, which the reader sets when the checkout ships
`deploy/docker-compose.srs-conf.yml` or the OME counterpart. That is
`main-v3` from the commit that added them. The bundled `main-v2` renders its
template and the editor says so. At deploy the orchestrator writes the file to
`<data root>/<name>/engine/srs.conf` (or `Server.xml`) and names it as
`SRS_CONF_FILE` or `OME_CONF_FILE` in `.env.<name>`, which the stack's
`build_compose_files` turns into a read-only mount. The data root survives a
manager deploy, which rsyncs only the checkout, and goes with the deployment
when it is removed.

Nothing is applied unchecked. A PUT first refuses a placeholder the version's
entrypoint does not fill, then asks the engine: for SRS, `srs -t` in a
throwaway container of the version's own image (`engineImages` in the
contract), on a copy with every placeholder filled by a dummy value, and the
line SRS names comes back as the 400. OvenMediaEngine has no test mode, so it
gets a well-formedness check and the watch. Then the deployment is claimed the
way a settings save claims it, the file stored, the engine recreated, and the
container inspected every two seconds for twenty. An engine that is not a
running container with no restarts by then gets the previous file back, is
recreated again, and `engine_config_error` on the profile says why, with the
engine's last log lines. The watch lives in the manager process: a manager
restart during those twenty seconds leaves the new file applied and nothing
reverted.

Where every directive is documented: SRS's annotated
[full.conf](https://github.com/ossrs/srs/blob/develop/trunk/conf/full.conf)
and OvenMediaEngine's
[configuration guide](https://airensoft.gitbook.io/ovenmediaengine/configuration).
The stack's own notes are in `engines/README.md` under "Your own config file".

### Stack versions

A version is a branch or tag of `swarm-hls-stream` pinned to a commit, checked
out and built once, with its deploy contract read out of the checkout rather
than assumed: the port table from `deploy/scripts/_lib.sh`, the port slot
ceiling from `deploy.sh`, the secrets the containers refuse to start without
from the `.env.sample` files, and the engine defaults from the entrypoints. A
moving branch changes nothing until `update` is called.

The **bundled** version is the submodule the manager ships with. It is the
default until another is chosen, and it cannot be removed or updated here: it
moves when the manager itself is deployed. Its commit comes from
`manager/.stack-commit`, which `deploy/deploy.sh` writes before the rsync,
because the tree reaches the server without a `.git`.

Every deployment runs one version, chosen in the new deployment wizard when
more than one has finished building and preselected to the default. `POST
/profiles` and `POST /groups` take `stack_version_id`, absent means the default,
and a version still building or failed is refused. A group's members all run
the version the group was made on. A deployment stays on its version: moving
one is not offered. Only a version marked **tested** can be made the default,
which a person sets by hand after one real deployment has run on it, because
reading a checkout's scripts proves its shape and not its behaviour.

What the version's contract decides for a deployment on it: the port table the
container snapshot and the OME ports are computed from, the port slot ceiling
(99 on `main-v3`, 999 on the bundled version), the engine defaults the settings
drawer names, whether the engine can run on a config file of its own, and the
secrets its containers refuse to start without. Those secrets,
`API_AUTH_TOKEN` and `SRS_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` on `main-v3`, are generated the first
time the deployment is deployed, 64 hex characters each, kept in
`profiles.stack_secrets`, written into `.env.<name>` at every deploy and never
answered by the API.

| Method | Path                    | Body            | Answer                                                          |
| ------ | ----------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/versions`             |                 | `[{ id, name, gitRef, commitSha, status, isDefault, tested, builtAt, lastError, contract, deployments }]` |
| POST   | `/versions`             | `{ name, ref }` | SSE build log, then `version.changed` on `/events`.              |
| POST   | `/versions/:id/update`  |                 | SSE build log. Refused for `bundled`.                            |
| POST   | `/versions/:id/default` |                 | 204. Refused for a version still building or not marked tested.  |
| PATCH  | `/versions/:id`         | `{ tested }`    | 200 and the row.                                                 |
| DELETE | `/versions/:id`         |                 | 204, or 409 with the deployment names when it is in use.         |

Adding and updating run `manager/scripts/stack-version-build.sh <root> <ref>
<repo-url>`, which clones or fetches, exports the fetched commit into a staging
tree beside the root, builds the packages there in a throwaway `node:22-alpine`
container, copies the built tree back into the root with every env file kept,
and copies `.env.sample` and `deploy/config.sample.json` into place. One build
runs at a time: the stack still tags its images by service name alone, so two
at once would overwrite each other's tags.

Adding a version runs that branch's deploy scripts with the manager's Docker
access, so only branches you trust belong here. The build container is shown
the staging tree and never the root, because the root holds every deployment's
`.env.<profile>` with its stream key, SRT passphrase and postage batch in it.

### Misc

| Method | Path        | Notes                             |
| ------ | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/health`   | DB ping. Returns `{status:"ok"}`. |
| GET    | `/services` | List of valid service names.      |

### Resource metrics

Real-time CPU / memory / network / disk usage at three nested layers: the
**host** (the whole box, including non-Docker usage), the **infra** (the sum of
all our containers), and **per container** (grouped by compose project, i.e.
profile).

| Method | Path              | Notes                                                              |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/metrics`        | Latest snapshot as JSON. `503` until the first sample is ready.    |
| GET    | `/metrics/stream` | Server-Sent Events; one `snapshot` event every ~2s while watching. |

Sampling is gated: the collector only polls Docker while at least one client is
connected to `/metrics/stream` (or immediately after a `/metrics` request).

Snapshot shape:

```jsonc
{
  "timestamp": "2026-06-07T14:30:00.000Z",
  "host":  { "cpuPercent": 37.2, "ncpu": 8,
             "memUsedBytes": 9663676416, "memTotalBytes": 33554432000,
             "diskUsedBytes": 81604378624, "diskTotalBytes": 512110190592 },
  "infra": { "cpuPercent": 142.5, "memUsageBytes": 5368709120,
             "netRxRate": 10485, "netTxRate": 20971, "containerCount": 6 },
  "containers": [
    { "id": "abc123…", "name": "streamer1-srs-1",
      "project": "streamer1", "service": "srs", "state": "running",
      "cpuPercent": 72.4, "memUsageBytes": 268435456,
      "memLimitBytes": 2147483648, "memPercent": 12.5,
      "netRxBytes": 1048576, "netTxBytes": 2097152,
      "netRxRate": 5120, "netTxRate": 10240,
      "blkReadBytes": 0, "blkWriteBytes": 4096,
      "blkReadRate": 0, "blkWriteRate": 2048, "pids": 14 }
  ]
}
```

Notes:

- `cpuPercent` is share-of-one-core × 100, so an 8-core box tops out at 800 and
  the host field is normalised to 0–100. `*Rate` fields are bytes/second derived
  from deltas, so they read `0` on the first sample after (re)connecting.
- **Host CPU/RAM/disk need read-only host mounts** (`/proc → /host/proc`,
  `/ → /host/rootfs`, already wired in `docker-compose.yml`). Without them,
  host fields fall back to capacity-only / `null`; infra and per-container
  numbers still work from the docker socket alone. Adding the mounts requires a
  redeploy.

Test without the UI (over the SSH tunnel, `ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 viewer`
exposes the web port; for the API use the manager port directly on the host):

```bash
# one-shot (cookies.txt comes from the sign-in under Example session)
curl -sS -b cookies.txt localhost:9876/metrics | jq

# live stream (Ctrl-C to stop)
curl -N -b cookies.txt localhost:9876/metrics/stream
```

## Example session

Sign in first. The cookie file carries the session through the rest, and every
request that is not a GET also needs the `X-Requested-With` header, without
which the manager answers 403 whatever the cookie says.

```bash
# Sign in once, keeping the session cookie in a file
curl -sS -c cookies.txt -X POST localhost:9876/auth/login \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Requested-With: streaming-infra-manager' \
  -d '{"username":"owner","password":"<the password>"}'

# Allocate streamer1 (port_slot=1)
curl -sS -b cookies.txt -X POST localhost:9876/profiles \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Requested-With: streaming-infra-manager' \
  -d '{"name":"streamer1","kind":"streamer"}'

# Allocate viewer1 (port_slot=2)
curl -sS -b cookies.txt -X POST localhost:9876/profiles \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Requested-With: streaming-infra-manager' \
  -d '{"name":"viewer1","kind":"viewer"}'


# Deploy and watch the logs stream
curl -N -b cookies.txt -X POST localhost:9876/profiles/streamer1/deploy \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Requested-With: streaming-infra-manager' -d '{}'
curl -N -b cookies.txt -X POST localhost:9876/profiles/viewer1/deploy \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Requested-With: streaming-infra-manager' -d '{}'

# Tear down + release
curl -N -b cookies.txt -X POST localhost:9876/profiles/streamer1/clean \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Requested-With: streaming-infra-manager' -d '{"volumes":true}'
curl -b cookies.txt -X DELETE localhost:9876/profiles/streamer1 \
  -H 'X-Requested-With: streaming-infra-manager'
```

## Environment

Everything comes from `manager/.env`, and `manager/.env.sample` documents each
key. The two that decide where the streaming stack lives:

| Variable              | Default                                            | What it points at                                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SHLS_ROOT`           | the submodule next to the manager source           | The bundled version's checkout. Set by `docker-compose.yml` to the host bind mount. |
| `STACK_VERSIONS_ROOT` | `/opt/streaming/streaming-infra-manager-versions` | Where added versions are checked out, one directory each.                           |

Both are bind-mounted into the api container at the same absolute path they
have on the host, because the docker daemon runs on the host and reads every
path in a compose file as a host path.

## Limitations (intentional, v1)

- **Max 999 managed profiles per host** — `--portSlot` is an integer 1–999.
- **No HTTPS of its own.** The sign-in gate is only as good as the transport in
  front of it. The `edge` service in `docker-compose.yml` is that transport: a
  Caddy container in the `public` compose profile that terminates TLS and gets
  its own certificate for `MANAGER_DOMAIN`. It starts only when that name is
  set, and `deploy/README.md` has the steps for turning it on.
- **Synchronous SSE.** A deploy holds an HTTP connection open for its duration;
  client disconnect kills the child.
- **Local target only.** This iteration assumes `config.json` deploys to
  `localhost`, which matches the "one manager per host" plan.
