/**
 * What the manager makes of a stream-uploader's own `/health`.
 *
 * Unit test, no database and no uploader. `pnpm test` in manager/.
 *
 * Decision D16 of 2026-09-17 lets an uploader start on a Bee node that is not
 * answering, so the wait for that node is a state the deployment page has to
 * show. The uploader reports it on `/health`, and this is the reading the page
 * is given. The stack pinned today answers none of the new fields, so a
 * manager talking to it has to read that as no waiting state reported rather
 * than as a fault.
