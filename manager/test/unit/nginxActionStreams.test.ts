/**
 * The deployment actions answer with a stream, and the proxy in front has to
 * know that.
 *
 * Every route in the actions router pipes a run handle to Server-Sent Events,
 * so the response lives as long as the deploy does and arrives a line at a
 * time. Behind a buffering proxy that is two faults at once: nothing reaches
 * the browser until the run ends, so the drawer sits there saying nothing, and
 * the proxy gives up on a gap between lines, so the browser is told 504 while
 * the manager goes on and finishes the work. the owner hit the second one starting
 * an uploader on 2026-09-15.
 *
 * nginx takes the FIRST regex location that matches, so covering these routes
 * means a block above the generic JSON one rather than a wider timeout on it.
