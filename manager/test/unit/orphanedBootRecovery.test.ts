/**
 * What boot makes of a deployment the manager was interrupted in the middle of.
 *
 * Unit test, no database and no Docker. `pnpm test` in manager/.
 *
 * A deploy takes minutes, so a restart inside one is ordinary. Boot used to
 * write ERROR over every row it found in DEPLOYING, STOPPING or REMOVING
 * without asking Docker anything, so a stack compose had already brought up
 * was reported as a failed deployment while it was streaming. Nothing later
 * repairs that: the containers a page shows are written from the environment
 * the manager computed, never compared with the daemon, so the wrong status
 * stands until somebody deploys again.
