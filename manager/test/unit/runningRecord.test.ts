/**
 * What a container record keeps of the environment its container was started
 * with, so the page can say which settings a running deployment is behind on.
 *
 * Unit test, no database and no Docker. `pnpm test` in manager/.
 *
 * the owner okayed a warning when the settings a deployment would get now differ
 * from what its running copy was started with (2026-09-25). A record therefore
 * has to answer "is this the same value" for every key its service reads,
 * secrets included, without holding a secret. It keeps a plain value for what
 * the page may show and a salted digest for everything, and a key the
 * environment did not set is in neither, because an unset key and an empty
 * one reach compose differently.
