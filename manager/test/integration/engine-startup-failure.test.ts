/**
 * T01: a config file the manager's own check accepts and the stack's startup gate refuses.
 *
 * The check asks SRS whether it would read the file. That is a parse, and a
 * parse cannot tell whether the engine will still be up in twenty seconds. So
 * a rollout stores the file and asks the stack to recreate the engine on it.
 * The stack's startup gate sees that SRS fell over and returns nonzero before
 * the manager commits RUNNING or starts its own watch. The manager records that
 * apply as failed and puts the previous file back. This test is the only place
 * that whole path runs against real containers.
 *
 * The file is the version's own template with one line added:
 *
 *     work_dir /no/such/directory;
 *
 * Two observations on ossrs/srs@sha256:2be08a0fe28737bf28bae8a575bb5776e09b620366dd1e62dd4f8a41cf4310f3,
 * which is the tag the stack runs, taken on this laptop on 2026-09-10 with the
 * template substituted the way the check substitutes it:
 *
 *   1. The parse the manager runs, `./objs/srs -t -c /check/srs.conf` in a
 *      throwaway container with --network none, exited 0 and printed
 *      "config file /check/srs.conf test is successful". So the check accepts
 *      this file, which is the whole point: a file the check refuses would
 *      never reach a rollout.
 *   2. The start the stack's entrypoint runs, `./objs/srs -c conf/srs.conf`,
 *      left the container exited with code 255 one second in, printing
 *      "Failed, code=-1 : chdir to /no/such/directory, r0=-1" and
 *      "do_main() [./src/main/srs_main_server.cpp:150][errno=2](No such file
 *      or directory)". SRS reads its config, then changes directory, and only
 *      the second step touches the file system.
 *
 * Both were taken again the same day, on this digest, after the first pin
 * turned out to name an image no tag points at any more. Same two answers:
 * the parse exited 0 and the start exited 255 on the chdir line.
 *
 * Run 35446479777 exercised this path against stack v3.1 on 2026-09-19. The
 * startup command refused the poisoned file and recovery brought the template
 * back. The first expectation incorrectly called that `reverted`, which is the
 * state for a later manager watch failure. See docs/ci.md.
