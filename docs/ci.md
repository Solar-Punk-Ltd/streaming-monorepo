# Checks

Two workflows under `.github/workflows`. Neither reaches a host, a Bee node or
funds. **A green check says nothing about a host, a Bee node or funds.**

## checks, required on every pull request and push to main-v2

Three jobs, all required, all on `ubuntu-latest`. Decision D06 of 2026-09-07:
turning the requirement on is a repository setting the owner makes after the
workflow has run once, and he keeps a bypass. Agents never push to `main-v2`.

### checks

Install from the frozen lockfile, build common, type checks in every package
with the test files included, the unit suites of common, manager and frontend,
the native transport suites, the frontend build.

What it proves: the code compiles, the unit-level guarantees hold, the
transport code that owns Unix sockets and forks children works, the frontend
bundles.

What it does not prove: anything that needs Docker, a Bee node, a host or
money. The manager's unit and native tests get a `DATABASE_URL` that names
nothing, because the config module requires the variable at load and those
tests never open a database.

### database

The 33 SQL suites in `manager/test/database/`, each against the task database
it owns, through `manager/test/database/run-all.mjs`.

Every one of those files gates itself on a task port variable and skips
silently when the variable is unset. Nothing set them before this job existed,
so a green check said nothing about the database ownership, admission and
recovery rules they pin. The runner closes that: it refuses in words when a
variable is unset or is not a port, connects to all nine databases before
anything runs, and treats one skipped test or a missing summary as a failure.

The nine databases and their variables live in one table, `TASK_DATABASES` in
that file. That table is the list. This page does not repeat it.

A Postgres 16 service container sits beside the runner with trust
authentication, and a first step creates the nine databases through the
image's own `createdb`, so the runner needs no client of its own and a service
that did not come up fails in seconds.

What it proves: those 518 tests run against a real PostgreSQL, and none of
them was skipped.

What it does not prove: anything about a deployment database. Every suite
connects to `127.0.0.1` and creates a schema of its own with synthetic rows.

The suite files run one at a time. Measured here on 2026-09-10 against nine
disposable databases: at the test runner's default file concurrency, two of
four full runs failed, once on the lock-ordering case in
`chequebookTargets.test.ts` and once on the spent-budget deadline in
`chequebookConnected.test.ts`. Both read the clock while another connection
holds a lock, so a loaded machine beats them and neither failure was a rule
being wrong. Serialized, three of three runs passed. It costs about 115
seconds a run, which is less than a required check that fails half the time.

### browser

The twenty suites under `frontend/test/`, of which fourteen drive a real
headless Chrome against a real Vite and six need neither. They live outside
`pnpm test`, which only takes `src`, so they ran nowhere on a pull request.
`pnpm --filter @streaming-infra-manager/frontend-prototype test:browser` takes
all of them.

The script runs under `node --import tsx --conditions=development` and not
under plain `node`, because `mock-engine-observations.test.mjs` reaches the
manager's TypeScript through `dev/mock-engine.mjs`, whose `.js` import
specifiers only tsx rewrites. Under plain `node` that one file fails on a
missing `omeXml.js`.

One file at a time, because each Chrome suite starts its own Vite and its own
Chrome. Concurrency 2 was not qualified: the rule was three consecutive
failure-free runs under three minutes, and the same class of clock-reading
failure had already shown up in the SQL job under parallel files, on a laptop
with three times the runner's cores. If it is worth the risk later, the
measurement to beat is below.

The job proves its Chrome before it starts. `CHROME_BIN` is
`/usr/bin/google-chrome` and a first step fails in words when nothing
executable is there, so a missing browser is a failed check and never a passed
one. Every launch also prints the browser it got and where it found it.

It carries the same Postgres service as the database job with `t09_test` alone,
because `transfer-connected-browser.test.mjs` signs into a real manager over a
real journal with the browser as the only client. That suite skips itself when
`T09_TEST_PG_PORT` is unset, which is the one silent-skip hole left in this
workflow: it is closed by the job setting the variable and creating the
database in a step that fails loudly, and by nothing else. Anyone removing
either would turn three passing cases into three invisible ones.

Screenshots and fixture evidence go under `RUNNER_TEMP`, where the fixtures
already put them. Nothing is uploaded. An upload action would be a new action,
and a new action needs the repository's four provenance checks recorded here
first.

### What a push costs

Measured on this laptop on 2026-09-10 (12 cores, arm64), test and build time
only, without install:

| Step | Wall time |
| --- | --- |
| common build | 1 s |
| type checks, every package | 5 s |
| unit suites, common 321, manager 2262, frontend 100 | 19 s |
| native transport suites, 7 | 2 s |
| frontend build | 5 s |
| SQL suites, 518, one file at a time | 161 s |
| browser suites, 144 | 354 s |

The three jobs run in parallel in wall-clock time but GitHub bills each one
separately, so a push costs the sum. A standard GitHub-hosted Linux runner on
a private repository has two virtual cores against this laptop's twelve, and
the work that dominates is serialized, so take the numbers above at roughly
one and a half to two and a half times, plus about a minute of install and
common build per job.

That puts `checks` at about 3 minutes, `database` at about 6, and `browser` at
about 13. **Estimate about 22 Actions minutes per push, somewhere between 18
and 28.** The browser job is more than half of it, which is the number to
watch if pushes become frequent. The first real run replaces this estimate
with a measurement.

## docker-backed checks, by hand

`workflow_dispatch` only, four jobs, so one failure never hides another and
each shows by name in the run.

**Not run yet.** No job in this workflow has ever run on a GitHub runner. The
first run is the owner's, and it is the check of the workflow itself: paths,
timings and image pulls may need a fix.

### srs-parser, T02

`manager/test/docker/srs-check-isolation.sh`, which runs the tsx driver beside
it. It calls the manager's own config checker, with its own command runner and
the engine image the stack runs, on eight files built from the stack's own SRS
template: four that change one directive's value and four that break a
different directive each. All eight checks are in flight at once.

What it proves: eight concurrent checks answer separately. Every valid file is
accepted, every refusal names the directive of its own file and none of the
other three, and the scratch directory is empty afterwards. A check that read
another check's copy would refuse with a directive the operator cannot find in
the file in front of them, which reads exactly like a real refusal.

What it does not prove: that any of those files would run. Nothing is started,
only parsed.

Locally: `bash manager/test/docker/srs-check-isolation.sh`. Exit 0 on a pass,
1 on a wrong answer, 2 on a harness problem. Run here on 2026-09-10, arm64,
Docker 29.7.2: pass, all eight right, 2 s.

### ome-gate, T03

`manager/test/docker/ome-admission-gate.sh`. SRT in, signed admission webhook
out, HLS playlist served, all in throwaway containers on a private network,
with a fake uploader that checks the signature the way the stack's uploader
does.

Locally: `bash manager/test/docker/ome-admission-gate.sh`.

**It failed here on 2026-09-10, for a reason that is about this laptop's
network and not about the engine.** The publisher container installs ffmpeg
with `apk add` before it publishes, and that took 93 seconds here, measured on
its own. The harness checks the publisher is alive 5 seconds after starting it,
which passes while apk is still working, and then gives the playlist 40
seconds, which expires long before ffmpeg exists. Re-run unchanged except for
a 180 second playlist budget, the gate passed in 123 seconds: SRT in, one
segment in the media playlist, a signed opening admission call for `video/gate`
and a closing call after the publisher ended, on
`airensoft/ovenmediaengine@sha256:172da912...`. The harness was not changed:
whether to wait for ffmpeg before starting the playlist clock is the owner's call,
and a runner with a fast package mirror may never see this.

### image-race, T05a

`manager/test/docker/shared-image-race.sh`. Two Compose projects building one
image name, reproduced and then closed with per-project image names.

Locally: `bash manager/test/docker/shared-image-race.sh [rounds]`. Run here on
2026-09-10, Docker 29.7.2 and Compose 5.5.1: pass in 137 s. The controlled
interleaving reproduced the race, the bounded control hit the window once in
20 creations, and the corrected variant put the right content under every one
of its 20 containers.

**The T05a qualification is a separate obligation this job does not
discharge.** It names Docker Engine 29.1.3 with Compose 5.1.4. The runner
carries Engine 28.0.4 and Compose 2.38.2, and this laptop carries 29.7.2 and
5.5.1. Neither is that pair. The harness prints the versions it ran on and a
step in the job puts them in the log before any build, so a run always says
what it was on. Printing versions is not the gate.

### integration, T10 and T01

The manager built and started on the runner with Postgres beside it, the user
created from the repository secret through the CLI's stdin, and the signed-in
integration suite run against it with `MANAGER_TEST_TARGET` declared. Real
containers are built and started on the runner and nowhere else. Nothing is
paid for.

Secrets the owner sets: `ITEST_PASSWORD`, the password of the user the suite signs
in as. The workflow refuses to start without it and never prints it. Only
whether it is set is ever looked at.

**`engine-startup-failure.test.ts` has never run.** It is T01's
container-backed startup failure: a config file the manager's own check accepts
and SRS exits on at start, asserted to end the rollout in `reverted` with the
deployment back `RUNNING` on the previous file and a card that offers nothing
to press. The file is the version's own template with one added line,
`work_dir /no/such/directory;`, and the two observations that make that the
right file, one for the parse and one for the start, are in the test's header
with the image digest and the date. It is typechecked and reviewed here and
nothing more. Its first execution is the owner's dispatch of this workflow.

Skips are visible: a missing secret fails the first step in words, and the
suite's own preflight refuses a target that is not declared.

## Runner facts

Read from the `actions/runner-images` Ubuntu 24.04 README
(`images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2404-Readme.md` on `main`) on **2026-09-10**, image
version 20260831.293.1:

| Fact | What the README says |
| --- | --- |
| Google Chrome | 152.0.7977.64, with ChromeDriver 152.0.7977.64 |
| Chromium | 152.0.7977.0 |
| Docker | Client 28.0.4, Server 28.0.4 |
| Docker Compose | 2.38.2 |
| PostgreSQL | 16.15, service disabled by default |
| Node.js | 22.23.2 |

The README names `CHROMEWEBDRIVER` and not the browser's own path, so
`CHROME_BIN` is set to `/usr/bin/google-chrome`, where the stable package puts
it, and the job's first step proves it rather than trusting it.

`createdb` is not needed on the runner: both jobs that need databases call it
inside the Postgres service container. Verified here on 2026-09-10 against
`postgres:16-alpine` at the digest below.

## Pinning

Actions are pinned by commit with the tag in a comment. **No action was added
or moved in this slice**, so no new provenance check was owed. The three
existing pins are unchanged:

| Action | Pin |
| --- | --- |
| `actions/checkout` | `3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1` (v7.0.1) |
| `pnpm/action-setup` | `0977fd99725f1db4007ccb2928dbb4e90d06cc86` (v6.0.10) |
| `actions/setup-node` | `820762786026740c76f36085b0efc47a31fe5020` (v7.0.0) |

pnpm itself comes from the `packageManager` field. When a pin moves, the new
tag's age and its commit are checked the way a dependency bump is: publish age,
signature and attestation, the installed tree where applicable, and known
malware, with the results recorded on this page. A release under two weeks old
is a flag and the newest release is the riskiest choice.

Container images are pinned by digest, each with the date it was resolved:

| Image | Digest | Resolved | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `postgres:16-alpine` | `sha256:cf78e76683b9ca8c5733cbbdce6c9262b45b6767934dd0a95e671f9a0fc20685` | 2026-09-10 | database, browser, integration |
| `ossrs/srs:6` | `sha256:2be08a0fe28737bf28bae8a575bb5776e09b620366dd1e62dd4f8a41cf4310f3` | 2026-09-10 | srs-parser, and the T01 observations |
| `airensoft/ovenmediaengine` | `sha256:172da9129d32093f3c92c426d385a318db38c7e70de0a3a685693e69614672a6` | 2026-09-08 | ome-gate |

## Running any of it here

From the repository root, with Docker running.

The SQL suites, on a disposable PostgreSQL of their own:

```sh
docker run --rm -d --name t20-pg -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust \
  -p 127.0.0.1:55432:5432 postgres:16-alpine
for name in t01_test t04a_test t04b_test t06_test t08_test t09_test t10_test t11_test t12_test; do
  docker exec t20-pg createdb -U postgres "$name"
done
export T01_TEST_PG_PORT=55432 T04A_TEST_PG_PORT=55432 T04B_TEST_PG_PORT=55432 \
  T06_TEST_PG_PORT=55432 T08_TEST_PG_PORT=55432 T09_TEST_PG_PORT=55432 \
  T10_TEST_PG_PORT=55432 T11_TEST_PG_PORT=55432 T12_TEST_PG_PORT=55432
pnpm --filter @streaming-infra-manager/api test:database
docker rm -f t20-pg
```

The browser suites, with the same container up so the connected one runs too:

```sh
export CHROME_BIN="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
export T09_TEST_PG_PORT=55432
pnpm --filter @streaming-infra-manager/frontend-prototype test:browser
```

The native transport suites, which need nothing but a `DATABASE_URL` that
names nothing:

```sh
pnpm --filter @streaming-infra-manager/api test:native
```

The three Docker harnesses, each on throwaway containers of its own run:

```sh
bash manager/test/docker/srs-check-isolation.sh
bash manager/test/docker/ome-admission-gate.sh
bash manager/test/docker/shared-image-race.sh
```

The deployment integration suite needs a running manager, a user and the
environment `op run --env-file` fills. See
[manager/test/integration/README.md](../manager/test/integration/README.md).
