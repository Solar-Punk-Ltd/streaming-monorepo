# Server deployment

Single-server deployment: postgres + manager API + nginx-served frontend, all
in one `docker compose` project. Team access via SSH tunnel — no public ports.

## One-time server bootstrap

Server runs as user `deploy`, code lives at `/opt/streaming/streaming-infra-manager`.

```sh
# As deploy@server
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin rsync
sudo usermod -aG docker deploy
# log out + back in so the group takes effect

mkdir -p ~/streaming-infra-manager/manager
```

Make sure `manager/.env` exists in your local checkout — it gets rsynced to
the server on every deploy (your laptop is the source of truth). Example:

```env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<pick-something>
LOG_LEVEL=info
WEB_PORT=8080
# DATABASE_URL is overridden inside the api container by docker-compose.yml.
# This value is only used if you also run `pnpm dev` on the server (you won't).
DATABASE_URL=postgres://manager:manager@localhost:5432/manager
MANAGER_PORT=9876
```

## Local `~/.ssh/config` snippet

```
Host control-1
  HostName <server-ip-or-hostname>
  User deploy
  LocalForward 8080 localhost:8080
```

## Deploying

From your local checkout:

```sh
./deploy/deploy.sh control-1
```

This rsyncs the repo (minus `node_modules`, `.git`, server `.env`), then
`docker compose up -d --build` on the server.

## The first user

The manager has a login, and there is no sign-up. Once, after the first deploy,
create a user on the server:

```sh
ssh control-1
cd ~/streaming-infra-manager/manager
docker compose exec -it api node dist/cli.js user:add <username>
```

It asks for the password twice with nothing echoed and writes only the hash.
Until it has been run, the manager answers 401 to everything but its health
check, and the sign-in page says so.

To feed the password from a vault instead of typing it:

```sh
op read "op://<vault>/<item>/password" | \
  docker compose exec -T api node dist/cli.js user:add <username> --password-stdin
```

Every later user is added from the Access page in the UI. Anyone signed in can
add or remove a user, and nobody can remove themselves or the last one left.

## Accessing

```sh
ssh control-1       # the LocalForward in ssh_config opens the tunnel
# then in your browser:
open http://localhost:8080
```

The sign-in page comes up first. A session lasts twelve hours of inactivity and
fourteen days at most.

If you skip the ssh_config entry: `ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 deploy@<server>`.

## Operations

All run on the server (`ssh control-1`, then `cd ~/streaming-infra-manager/manager`):

```sh
docker compose ps                 # status
docker compose logs -f api        # tail manager logs
docker compose logs -f web        # tail nginx logs
docker compose restart api        # restart just the manager
docker compose down               # stop everything (postgres volume kept)
docker compose down -v            # nuke postgres data too — be sure
```

## Architecture notes

- **`web`** (nginx:alpine) is the only service that publishes a port off-host
  (`8080:80`). It serves the built React SPA and reverse-proxies `/profiles`,
  `/groups`, `/health`, `/services`, `/events` to `api:9876`.
- **`api`** has no published port — only reachable via the `web` proxy on
  the internal compose network.
- **`postgres`** is bound to `127.0.0.1:5432` so a host-side `pnpm dev`
  (during local iteration) can connect, but it's never reachable off-host.
- The whole repo is bind-mounted into the `api` container at the same
  absolute path it has on the host (`/opt/streaming/streaming-infra-manager`).
  This is so compose files under `manager/swarm-hls-stream/` resolve volume
  paths consistently when their `docker compose up` is forwarded to the host
  daemon via the mounted socket.
