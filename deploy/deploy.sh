#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Deploy the streaming-infra-manager to a server via rsync + remote build.
#
#   ./deploy/deploy.sh [ssh-target]
#
# ssh-target defaults to `viewer` (configure in ~/.ssh/config). Example:
#   Host viewer
#     HostName <ip>
#     User deploy
#     LocalForward 8080 localhost:8080
#
# What it does:
#   1. Builds swarm-hls-stream locally so its dist/ artifacts ship over rsync
#      (the host docker daemon mounts those into sibling containers spawned
#      by the manager, so they must exist on the server filesystem).
#   2. rsyncs the repo to /opt/streaming/streaming-infra-manager.
#      Excludes node_modules, build caches and .git. Both .env files (the
#      manager's and swarm-hls-stream's) DO ship, and --delete means this
#      checkout is the only source of truth for them.
#   3. SSHes in and runs `docker compose up -d --build --remove-orphans`.
#      Builds happen on the server, so the image tags match the server's
#      docker engine. With MANAGER_DOMAIN set, the `public` profile joins in
#      and starts the TLS edge. With it cleared, the edge is removed by name
#      and the removal is checked, because dropping a profile does not stop a
#      container already running under it.
