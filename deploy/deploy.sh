# Deploy the streaming-infra-manager to a server via rsync + remote build.
#
#   ./deploy/deploy.sh [ssh-target]
#
# ssh-target defaults to `viewer` (configure in ~/.ssh/config). Example:
#   Host viewer
#     HostName <ip>
#     User deploy
#     LocalForward 8080 localhost:8080
#
# What it does:
#   1. Builds swarm-hls-stream locally so its dist/ artifacts ship with the
#      stack (the host docker daemon mounts those into sibling containers
#      spawned by the manager, so they must exist on the server filesystem).
#   2. rsyncs the repo to /opt/streaming/streaming-infra-manager, without
#      manager/swarm-hls-stream: the tree the engines of existing deployments
#      mount is never written over again, so a container restart keeps the
#      files it was started with. Excludes node_modules, build caches and
#      .git. The manager's .env DOES ship, and --delete means this checkout
#      is the only source of truth for it.
#   3. Seals the streaming stack into one package with `bundled:seal`. The
#      package holds the files of the commit the checkout is on, the two
#      built directories, the stack's own .env, deploy config and engine
#      envs, and a manifest naming every path with its hash. It is copied to
#      the host under a staging name and renamed once every file arrived, so
#      the host never reads a package a dropped connection left half copied.
#      Nothing about it is published yet.
#   4. Builds the images on the server, decides there whether this host has
#      ever run the manager, and then runs `manager:upgrade` in a one-off
#      container of the image just built. The first use question is answered
#      before that container exists, because preparing it can create the
#      project's volumes, and it stops the deploy when the data volume is gone
#      from under an installed manager. The command owns the rest:
#      it holds one directory for the whole run so a second upgrade cannot
#      start beside it, stops the old api, checks the package against the
#      identity it was given, migrates, publishes the package as an immutable
#      build the bundled version deploys from, starts the project and waits
#      for the api to answer. A container keeps what it mounts until its own
#      deployment is deployed. With MANAGER_DOMAIN set the upgrade is asked
#      for the public TLS edge, and without it the edge is removed by name and
#      the removal is checked, because dropping a profile does not stop a
#      container already running under it.
