 * was handed. `PUT /profiles/:name` carries neither `kind` nor `components`,
 * so every one of them silently passed on update:
 *
 *  - `bee_url` was accepted on a profile that runs a local bee-uploader, which
 *    is the "stores a value that never applies" state the create-side check
 *    exists to prevent — deploy.sh's resolve_bee_url outranks the stored value.
 *  - `bee_url` was accepted next to a stored `bee_publishers`, so a config
 *    could say two different things about where uploads go.
 *  - an abr-uploader could be left with no `bee_publishers` at all, which the
 *    create path declares mandatory. That one is the worst of the three: the
 *    next deploy writes no BEE_PUBLISHERS/ABR_ENABLED/ABR_LADDER, the uploader
 *    falls back to BEE_URL, and it crash-loops while the manager says RUNNING.
 *
 * Stated once, over the *resulting* profile rather than over a patch, and
 * checked by ProfileService on both create and update — so the two paths cannot
 * disagree about what a valid destination is.
