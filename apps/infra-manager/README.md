# streaming-infra-manager

Deployment and orchestration tooling for testing the Swarm HLS live-streaming
stack. Targets two dedicated servers:

- **Streamer**: Bee light node, `stream-uploader` service, SRS.
- **Watcher**: N lightweight Docker containers running a Bee ultra-light node
  and the React streaming client, plus a small interface to start and stop them.

It also deploys the two halves of an ABR stage, which normally run on this one
host under this manager:

- **ABR Node Pool**: a deployment group with one Bee node per quality rung, as
  the publish targets. Produces the `BEE_PUBLISHERS` string.
- **ABR Uploader**: `srs` and `stream-uploader` publishing to that pool. It has
  no Bee node and no postage of its own. The wizard copies the pool's
  `BEE_PUBLISHERS` string into it.

An uploader on another machine is possible, and it needs two things: a
`BEE_LOCAL_HOST` naming an address that machine can reach, and a Bee API bind
that admits it. See [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md) for the bind.

See [docs/features/abr-ladder.md](docs/features/abr-ladder.md).

## Layout

- `manager/swarm-hls-stream/`: a git submodule pointing at
  [Solar-Punk-Ltd/swarm-hls-stream](https://github.com/Solar-Punk-Ltd/swarm-hls-stream),
  pinned to the stack's release `v3.4`, commit
  `dc0c55e10651367d939b2b0c2c4ff6302fc65899`, as of 2026-09-25, with `main` as
  its tracked branch. This is the upstream application source, with the
  packages under `packages/` and the engine trees under `engines/`. The commit
  it records is the **bundled** stack version, and that version is the default
  until another is chosen. A deploy does not carry this tree. It writes the
  recorded commit into `manager/.stack-commit`, and the server fetches and
  builds that commit itself, the same way it builds any version added on the
  Versions page.
- `/home/solarpunk/streaming-infra-manager-versions/` on the deploy host
  (`STACK_VERSIONS_ROOT`). Each version keeps three siblings there:
  `<name>.repo/`, the clone it builds from, `<name>.builds/<build id>/`, one
  immutable directory per published build, and `<name>/`, the settings files
  the operator owns. A build is a checkout with its packages built, so it runs
  to about a gigabyte, and more than one build of a version can be kept at
  once. The root is a sibling of the data root and sits outside the tree
  `deploy/deploy.sh` rsyncs with `--delete`, so a manager deploy cannot wipe
  it. The Versions page adds, updates, configures and removes these. See
  [docs/features/stack-versions.md](docs/features/stack-versions.md) and
  [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md).
- `/home/solarpunk/streaming-infra-manager-data/<deployment>/` on the deploy
  host (`BEE_DATA_ROOT`): the deployment's Bee node data and keys, and under
  `engine/` the config file of its own when it runs on one. Survives a manager
  deploy, removed with the deployment. See
  [docs/features/engine-config.md](docs/features/engine-config.md).
- `/home/solarpunk/manager-ssh/` on the deploy host (`MANAGER_SSH_DIR`): the ssh
  identity the manager deploys to *other* hosts with (the deploy key, an
  `ssh_config` with a `Host` block per target alias, and `known_hosts`),
  bind-mounted into the api container at `/root/.ssh`. Another sibling outside
  the tree `deploy/deploy.sh` rsyncs, and only needed when a deployment's host
  is not `localhost`. See [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md).

## Checks

The `checks` workflow declares four jobs on every pull request and push to
`main` (and `main-v2` during the release transition): the build and the unit suites, the SQL suites against nine
disposable databases, the browser suites against a real headless Chrome, and a
build of the web and api images the way a deploy builds them on the host. A
second workflow, started by hand, runs the container-backed regressions and the
signed-in integration suite. Its five runs on push events of 2026-09-10 and
2026-09-11 all failed. Dispatched by hand, it first passed on 2026-09-19 (run
35447516491) and has passed on every stack pin move since, most recently run
36099132624 on 2026-09-25 for `v3.4`, read on GitHub that day. What each job proves, what it does not, and how to
run any of it on a laptop: [docs/ci.md](docs/ci.md).

## Cloning this repository

This repo uses a **git submodule** (the `manager/swarm-hls-stream/` directory). A plain
`git clone` will leave that directory empty, which will break every later step.
Use one of the two flows below.

### Option A, clone everything in one go (recommended)

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Solar-Punk-Ltd/streaming-infra-manager.git
cd streaming-infra-manager
```

The `--recurse-submodules` flag tells git to also fetch the contents of every
submodule. After this completes, `manager/swarm-hls-stream/` will be populated.

### Option B, you already cloned without the flag

If you ran a plain `git clone` and `manager/swarm-hls-stream/` is empty, run this once
inside the repo:

```sh
cd streaming-infra-manager
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

`--init` registers the submodule locally, which is needed the first time only.
`--recursive` also pulls any submodules of submodules. Re-running this is safe
at any time and does not overwrite committed work.

### How to tell it worked

```sh
ls manager/swarm-hls-stream/packages
```

That should print several package directories, `cli`, `client` and
`stream-uploader` among them. If the directory is empty, the submodule was not
fetched. Go back to Option A or B.

## Updating the upstream submodule

The bundled stack is pinned to the stack's release `v3.4`, commit `dc0c55e1`,
as of 2026-09-25. It builds on `v3.1`, pinned from 2026-09-19, which
brought PR #241 and the manager integration work previously carried by
`feat/manager-line`. Over `v3.1` it makes SRT ingest wait 2000 ms for a lost
packet by default, where `v3.1` asked for 200 ms and SRS waited its own
120 ms, because the template filled `latency` and not `recvlatency`. An SRS
encoder that drops and returns inside the reap window, 60 s by default, now
resumes its broadcast instead of starting a new one, while OME still ends it.
Both came with `v3.2`. `v3.3` adds three fixes for what a tester hit on
2026-09-23. A ladder with a rung that cannot finish, such as one whose postage
batch filled, is listed as a recording of the rungs that did finish, instead of
staying live for good and hiding every broadcast after it. A rung whose uploads
are refused stays out of the master playlist until it uploads cleanly again.
And the viewer's stream cards show their picture behind its `/bee` proxy.
`v3.4` adds the fixes from that tester's stage and from a live test of it on
2026-09-24 and 2026-09-25. The uploader starts on a full mutable postage
batch, whose node overwrites its oldest chunks rather than refusing an upload,
and holds only an immutable batch to its start ceiling. A long recording's card
shows its picture. The viewer's page tells browsers to check for a new copy on
every load, so a redeploy reaches every browser. A viewer who saw a broadcast end follows it when it comes back,
and a watch page opened before a scheduled stream starts picks it up when it
does. An ordinary end of a broadcast no longer logs that the engine may have
died. And the ingest refuses a publish nobody authenticated unless the stack's
own transcoder sent it from the same host.
The upstream default branch is `main`.

Pin an explicit release or commit when upgrading the bundled stack, a release
when one carries the change you need and a commit when none does yet. `<ref>`
below is either one, a tag such as `v3.4` or a full commit id such as
`8c5c583a9fdd4604a602433112410f5a996952ee`:

```sh
git -C manager/swarm-hls-stream fetch origin --tags
git -C manager/swarm-hls-stream checkout --detach <ref>
git add manager/swarm-hls-stream
git commit -m "chore: pin swarm-hls-stream <ref>"
```

The fetch brings every branch and every tag of the stack, so a release tag and
a commit on any branch both resolve.

To test the latest upstream `main` instead, use the tracked branch:

```sh
git submodule update --remote manager/swarm-hls-stream
git add manager/swarm-hls-stream
git commit -m "chore: bump swarm-hls-stream"
```

Give the path, `manager/swarm-hls-stream`, and not the submodule's name. The
first command moves the submodule to the tip of the tracked branch. The next
two record that move as a commit here, so every clone pins the same version,
and so does the next deploy, which writes that commit into
`manager/.stack-commit` for the server to build.
