/**
 * Composing a rung's bee API address.
 *
 * Unit test — no database, no Docker, no bee. `pnpm test` in manager/.
 *
 * The port half is arithmetic and safe (`port_slot` is `CHECK BETWEEN 1 AND 999`,
 * so the slot-0 case where deploy.sh keeps the env's own ports cannot occur). The
 * host half is not: `profiles.host` holds a *deploy* target, validated to allow
 * `@` and documented as "localhost, an ssh alias, or user@host". Dropped verbatim
 * into `http://{host}:{port}` a `user@host` target yields an address that is not a
 * bee base URL — and whose stray `@` lands inside a BEE_PUBLISHERS entry format
 * that already separates the rung from the URL on `@`. An alias is no better: it
 * is a key into an ssh config, so `http://vultr-eu-1:10055` resolves nowhere.
 *
 * Both are undone by `resolveNetworkHost`. How it resolves an alias is pinned in
 * deployHost.test.ts, where `ssh -G` is injected. Here the concern is only what
 * the URL composes to.
