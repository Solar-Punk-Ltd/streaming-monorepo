/**
 * How many private copies a deployment keeps, and which one it is running from.
 *
 * Unit test, no database and no Docker. `pnpm test` in manager/.
 *
 * Levi's decision (D11): one copy per deployment, replaced on the next
 * successful deploy, the previous one kept until that deploy is healthy. So a
 * deploy that fails leaves the tree that last worked in place, and a deploy
 * that succeeds takes it. Anything older than the previous goes as soon as a
 * new deploy launches, which is what stops repeated failures filling the disk.
 *
 * This file decides only which copies are offered for retirement. Whether one
 * may actually go is the database's answer, under its own locks.
