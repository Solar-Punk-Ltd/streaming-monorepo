/**
 * Resolving a deploy target into a network address.
 *
 * Unit test, no ssh is ever run: every case injects the `ssh -G` step, which is
 * the whole reason `createNetworkHostResolver` takes one.
 *
 * `profiles.host` is a deploy target, and deploy.sh only ever hands it to `ssh`.
 * The manager also composes HTTP URLs from it, and an ssh alias is not an
 * address: `http://vultr-eu-1:10055` resolves nowhere, so the probes time out
 * and a BEE_PUBLISHERS entry built from it is unusable on the host that gets it.
 * These pin the same semantics deploy/scripts/_lib.sh's `host_from_target` has,
 * plus the two things a shell function does not have to care about: an exec
 * boundary that must not trust its input, and a cache.
