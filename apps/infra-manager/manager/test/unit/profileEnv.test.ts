/**
 * What writeProfileEnv puts in .env.<profile> for a pool-backed uploader.
 *
 * Unit test — no database, no Docker, no bee. `pnpm test` in manager/.
 *
 * Three things have to hold at once or the uploader on the other machine will
 * not start: BEE_PUBLISHERS reaches the file unquoted (deploy.sh's line parser
 * and compose both take an unquoted value literally, and the engine's own sample
 * writes it that way), ABR_ENABLED goes with it, and ABR_LADDER names exactly the
 * rungs the publishers cover — the uploader refuses any mismatch.
