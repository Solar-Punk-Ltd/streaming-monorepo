/**
 * The ports the WHATWG fetch standard calls bad ports, every row of its table at
 * https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#port-blocking, as read on 2026-10-07.
 *
 * Node's fetch and every browser refuse an HTTP request to one of these before
 * anything is sent, while curl and other clients reach it fine. A deployment
 * holding one looks healthy from a shell and dead from the uploader's own
 * healthcheck and from the admin, which is what slot 8 did with the API port
 * 10080 on 2026-10-07.
