 * The environment a stack script is handed, with the manager's own names taken
 * out of it.
 *
 * The manager runs in a container whose environment names many of the same
 * things a deployment does, and on every one of those names the manager's
 * value is the one that wins. `load_env_file` in the stack's `_lib.sh` reads
 * the deployment's env file as defaults and leaves an already exported
 * variable standing, and docker compose prefers a shell variable over an
 * `--env-file` value. So `LOG_LEVEL=debug`, set for the manager, becomes the
 * stream-uploader's log level too, and `BEE_DATA_ROOT`, which here is where
 * one deployment's own files live, is in the stack the parent of every Bee
 * node's data directory.
 *
 * What is removed is named rather than what is kept, so everything a script
 * legitimately reads from the machine it runs on, PATH, HOME, SSH_AUTH_SOCK,
 * DOCKER_HOST and the rest, still reaches it.
