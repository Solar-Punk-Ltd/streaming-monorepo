#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Deploy the streaming-infra-manager to a server via rsync + remote build.
#
#   ./deploy/deploy.sh [ssh-target]
#
# ssh-target defaults to `viewer` (configure in ~/.ssh/config). Example:
#   Host viewer
#     HostName <ip>
#     User solarpunk
#     LocalForward 8080 localhost:8080
#
# What it does:
#   1. Writes the stack commit this repository pins into manager/.stack-commit,
#      read from the repository itself rather than from a checkout, so a laptop
#      that never initialised the submodule still ships the right pin. That file
#      is the only thing about the streaming stack a deploy carries. The host
#      fetches that commit from GitHub and builds it there, through the same
#      path a version added in the UI takes.
#   2. rsyncs the repo to /home/solarpunk/streaming-infra-manager, without
#      manager/swarm-hls-stream: the tree the engines of existing deployments
#      mount is never written over again, so a container restart keeps the
#      files it was started with. Excludes node_modules, build caches and
#      .git. The manager's .env DOES ship, and --delete means this checkout
#      is the only source of truth for it.
#   3. Builds the images on the server, decides there whether this host has
#      ever run the manager, and then runs `manager:upgrade` in a one-off
#      container of the image just built. The first use question is answered
#      before that container exists, because preparing it can create the
#      project's volumes, and it stops the deploy when the data volume is gone
#      from under an installed manager. The command owns the rest:
#      it holds one directory for the whole run so a second upgrade cannot
#      start beside it, stops the old api, migrates, starts the project, waits
#      for the api to answer, and then waits for the api's own boot to finish
#      building the pinned stack commit. With MANAGER_DOMAIN set the upgrade is
#      asked for the public TLS edge, and without it the edge is removed by name
#      and the removal is checked, because dropping a profile does not stop a
#      container already running under it.
#
# The streaming stack's own settings live on the server, under the versions
# root, and no deploy reads or writes them. See deploy/README.md.
