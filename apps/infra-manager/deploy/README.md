# Server deployment

Single-server deployment: postgres + manager API + nginx-served frontend, all
in one `docker compose` project. Team access over an SSH tunnel, with no public
port, until a domain is set and the Caddy edge gives it HTTPS. See "Opening the
manager to the internet" below.

## One-time server bootstrap

Server runs as user `solarpunk`, code lives at `/home/solarpunk/streaming-infra-manager`.

```sh
# As solarpunk@server
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin rsync
sudo usermod -aG docker solarpunk
# log out + back in so the group takes effect

mkdir -p ~/streaming-infra-manager/manager
```

Make sure `manager/.env` exists in your local checkout. It gets rsynced to
the server on every deploy, so your laptop is the source of truth. Example:

```env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<pick-something>
LOG_LEVEL=info
WEB_PORT=8080
# DATABASE_URL is overridden inside the api container by docker-compose.yml.
# This value is only used if you also run `pnpm dev` on the server (you won't).
DATABASE_URL=postgres://manager:manager@localhost:5432/manager
MANAGER_PORT=9876
# Empty until the manager goes public. See "Opening the manager to the internet".
MANAGER_DOMAIN=
```

## Local `~/.ssh/config` snippet

```
Host manager-host
  HostName <server-ip-or-hostname>
  User solarpunk
  LocalForward 8080 localhost:8080
```

## Deploying

From your local checkout:

```sh
./deploy/deploy.sh manager-host
```

This rsyncs the repo, then builds the images on the server and runs the upgrade
command that brings the project back up. The rsync leaves out `node_modules`,
`.git`, build caches, `.scratch/` and `manager/swarm-hls-stream/`.

`manager/.env` is the one env file that travels with it, and `rsync --delete`
means your checkout is the only source of truth for that file: an edit made on
the server is undone by the next deploy. **The streaming stack's own `.env` is
the opposite, and editing it in your checkout does nothing.** The submodule
directory is excluded from the rsync, so nothing under it reaches the server.
The stack's settings live on the server and are edited there, as "Where the
streaming stack's settings live" below describes.

## What a deploy does to the bundled stack

The streaming stack the manager ships with is a version like any other, called
`bundled`, and the server fetches and builds it there. The only thing about the
stack a deploy carries is one commit.

**Pin.** The deploy writes `manager/.stack-commit` from the repository itself,
with `git rev-parse HEAD:manager/swarm-hls-stream`, so it is the commit the
submodule pin records whether or not you have the submodule checked out. That
file ships with the repo rsync. Nothing of the stack is installed or built on
your machine.

**Build, on the server.** When the API starts it reads that pin. If the bundled
version is not already on a complete build of that commit, it fetches the commit
from GitHub into `~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/bundled.repo` and builds it
in a throwaway `node:22-alpine` container, exactly as it does for a version you
add in the UI. The build log is on the Versions page. A build that fails leaves
a failed version row with the reason, and Update on the bundled card runs it
again. The API starts either way: a stack that could not be fetched never stops
the manager coming up.

**Upgrade.** The server builds its images, then runs `manager:upgrade` in a
one-off container of the image it has just built. That command creates
`~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/.manager-upgrade` and holds it for the whole
run, so a second deploy started beside this one refuses instead of interleaving
with it. Inside the guard it decides whether Postgres may be started, reads the
schema, stops the old API, migrates the database with no old API running, starts
the project, waits for the new API to answer its health check, and then waits for
that API's own boot to finish building the pinned commit. `--bundled-timeout`
says how long that last wait may take, twenty minutes by default, and you can
raise it for a first build on a cold host with
`BUNDLED_TIMEOUT=3600 ./deploy/deploy.sh manager-host`. It prints one line of
JSON with the state and the bundled build, which the deploy echoes. A bundled
build that failed or ran out of time makes the deploy exit non zero after the
manager is already up, so the fix is Update on the Versions page rather than
another deploy.

**Where builds live.** Each published build is one immutable directory at
`~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/bundled.builds/<build id>`. Nothing is ever
written into a build again, and the previous one is kept. The tree the engines
mount, `manager/swarm-hls-stream` on the server, is never written over by a
deploy any more.

A running container keeps the files it was started with until its own deployment
is deployed again. Updating the manager does not restart anybody's stream and
does not move a deployment onto the new build.

## Where the streaming stack's settings live

On the server, in `~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/bundled/`: the base `.env`,
`deploy/config.json` and `engines/<engine>/.env`. They are the operator's files
and no deploy reads or writes them.

The first build on a host that was deployed the old way takes them over from
`manager/swarm-hls-stream` on the server, byte for byte, as the first revision.
After that the tree is only ever read, because running engines still mount it.

A version that adds a setting ships it in its `.env.sample`, and the build
completes the host's own file from that sample rather than refusing: the sample's
own line for each missing key is appended, blank where the sample leaves it
blank, and the log names the keys it added. Your own lines are never touched.

Edit them from the manager: **Settings** on a version card opens a page holding
every one of those files, with what the version's own sample says about each key
beside it. **Save** commits the whole set as one revision, and **Save and apply**
publishes another build of the same commit carrying it, which is what new
deployments then run. Redeploy the deployments that should pick it up.

The editing script is still there for work over ssh, and commits the same
revision the page does. Run it with `sudo`: the manager's api container runs as
root, so every file under the versions root belongs to root, and each of them is
readable by its owner alone.

```sh
ssh manager-host
cd ~/streaming-infra-manager/manager
sudo scripts/stack-config-edit.sh ~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/bundled set .env /tmp/new-env
sudo scripts/stack-config-edit.sh ~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/bundled commit
```

Both take the same lock, so a save from the page and an edit over ssh cannot
write over each other. While the script holds it the page says so and offers
another go, and a lock whose editor is gone comes off with
`sudo scripts/stack-config-edit.sh <root> --unlock`. Update on the Versions
page still works too: it builds the version again and captures whatever
revision is current.

## Deploying Bee nodes to other hosts

A deployment's **Host** field is a deploy target: `localhost`, an ssh alias, or
`user@host`. Only the exact value `localhost` means the manager's own machine:
`deploy.sh` reaches anything that names another host over `ssh`, and so does the
manager, from inside the api container, which has no ssh identity of its own.

That identity lives on the manager host in `/home/solarpunk/manager-ssh/`
(`MANAGER_SSH_DIR` in `manager/.env` overrides the path). It holds the deploy
key pair, an `ssh_config` and a `known_hosts`:

```sh
# As solarpunk@manager-host
mkdir -p ~/manager-ssh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N '' -f ~/manager-ssh/deploy_key
ssh-copy-id -i ~/manager-ssh/deploy_key.pub deploy@203.0.113.7
```

One `Host` block per target in `~/manager-ssh/ssh_config`. `IdentityFile` is the
path *inside the container*, where the directory is mounted at `/root/.ssh`:

```
Host bee-eu-1
  HostName 203.0.113.7
  User deploy
  IdentityFile /root/.ssh/deploy_key
```

`docker-compose.yml` mounts the directory at `/root/.ssh`, and the api image
links `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` to the `ssh_config` inside it, so the aliases are
read as the system-wide config. That link is what makes the file usable: ssh
refuses a per-user config it does not own, and a bind-mounted file keeps the
host's uid. `deploy.sh` creates the directory on every deploy, empty, as the
user it deploys as, so a manager that deploys only to itself needs nothing here
and the link points at nothing, which ssh treats as no config. Until 2026-09-16
the file itself was bind-mounted too, and a host without it could not start the
upgrade container: Docker made a root-owned directory at the missing path and
refused to mount it onto a file.

Put the target's host key in `~/manager-ssh/known_hosts` before the first
deploy. The manager's own ssh calls pass `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes` on the
command line, which overrides an `accept-new` in the config file and refuses a
host it does not already know:

```sh
ssh-keyscan -H 203.0.113.7 >> ~/manager-ssh/known_hosts
```

The manager verifies a target by running `docker info` over that same ssh path
and recording the daemon id it reads back, then re-checks that id on every
deploy, stop, remove and port observation, so the alias must resolve in
`ssh_config`, the key must authenticate without a prompt (`BatchMode=yes`), and
the host key must already be in `known_hosts`.

Links and addresses do not go through ssh at all. The manager resolves the alias
with `ssh -G` against the same config and puts the result on every profile as
`network_host`, which is what the UI's component links and a rung's Bee API
address in `BEE_PUBLISHERS` are built from. A browser never sees `bee-eu-1`.

`BEE_DATA_ROOT` describes the manager's host only. A Bee node on a remote target
keeps its data where the stack's own default puts it on that host,
`deploy/data/` under the rsynced stack directory (`~/swarm-hls-stream-<name>`
of the ssh user), and the manager exports no data directory for such a deploy
at all. Neither the disk figure it reports nor the data-directory cleanup it
runs on removal reaches that host.

## A deploy that stopped half way

If a deploy failed after the upgrade started, the guard directory is still
there:

```sh
ssh manager-host
ls ~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/.manager-upgrade
cat ~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/.manager-upgrade/owner.json
```

`owner.json` names the phase it stopped in: `checking`, `stopping`, `migrating`,
`starting`, `verifying` or `bundled`. The next deploy refuses while that
directory exists and prints the path and the phase rather than clearing it,
because from `stopping` onwards the API may be down and only a person can tell
whether the host is in a state worth keeping.

What to look at before removing it:

```sh
cd ~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/.manager-upgrade   # read the phase
cd ~/streaming-infra-manager/manager
docker compose ps                 # is the api up, is postgres healthy
docker compose logs --tail 200 api
```

The database is safe to leave as it is. The upgrade publishes nothing itself,
and a build the API had started either finished into its own immutable directory
or left a staging directory the next boot removes.

When the host looks sound, remove the directory by hand and deploy again:

```sh
rm -r ~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/.manager-upgrade
```

### What a stopped deploy leaves behind

Nothing that has to be cleaned by hand. A deploy ships no package of the
streaming stack any more, so there is no `bundled.packages/` directory to sweep
and no copy of anybody's secrets waiting in one. A host that was deployed the old
way may still have that directory from before this change: nothing reads it now,
and it holds the `.env`, `deploy/config.json` and engine envs of every deploy
that shipped one, so remove it once no deploy is running.

```sh
ssh manager-host
ls ~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/bundled.packages    # if it is still there
rm -r ~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/bundled.packages
```

What a build that was interrupted leaves is a `tmp-<attempt>` directory under
`~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/bundled.builds/`. The next boot removes it,
unless its build container is still running, and never removes a published build.
Never remove anything else under `bundled.builds/`, which is where the published
builds live.

## The first user

The manager has a login, and there is no sign-up. Once, after the first deploy,
create a user on the server:

```sh
ssh manager-host
cd ~/streaming-infra-manager/manager
docker compose exec -it api node dist/cli.js user:add <username>
```

It asks for the password twice with nothing echoed and writes only the hash.
Until it has been run, the manager answers 401 to everything but its health
check, and the sign-in page says so.

To feed the password from a vault instead of typing it:

```sh
op read "op://<vault>/<item>/password" | \
  docker compose exec -T api node dist/cli.js user:add <username> --password-stdin
```

Every later user is added from the Access page in the UI. Only an admin can
add or remove a user, and nobody can remove themselves, the last user or the
last admin.

## Accessing

```sh
ssh manager-host       # the LocalForward in ssh_config opens the tunnel
# then in your browser:
open http://localhost:8080
```

The sign-in page comes up first. A session lasts twelve hours of inactivity and
fourteen days at most.

If you skip the ssh_config entry: `ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 solarpunk@<server>`.

## Opening the manager to the internet

The tunnel is the default and costs nothing to keep. Going public is these five
steps, in this order. The order is the point: a login on the manager protects
nothing while a Bee node's API sits open beside it, because that API needs no
password and can spend the node's postage and, with a whitelist, its money.

### 1. Prove the login works, over the tunnel

Deploy as above, create the first user with the CLI, sign in through the tunnel
and click around. Nothing below is worth doing until the gate is real.

### 2. Bind the node and engine APIs off the public interface

Each deployment publishes the API of every Bee node it runs, on the ports
ending 5 and 7 for its slot, and the three HTTP ports its engines serve, all by
default on every interface. Set them to the Docker bridge address instead.
**A firewall is no substitute for this**: Docker publishes a container port by
rewriting the packet's destination and forwarding it, so a firewall's input
rules never see it at all, and the forward rules of step 3 filter it one way in
rather than closing it. The binding is the control.

The five settings live on the server, in
`~/streaming-infra-manager-versions/bundled/.env`, and no deploy reads or writes
that file. Edit it there with the editing script, as under "Where the streaming
stack's settings live" above. Find the bridge address with
`ip -4 addr show docker0` on the server, usually `172.17.0.1`:

```env
BEE_UPLOADER_API_BIND=172.17.0.1
BEE_GATEWAY_API_BIND=172.17.0.1
SRS_HTTP_API_BIND=172.17.0.1
SRS_HTTP_BIND=172.17.0.1
OME_HTTP_BIND=172.17.0.1
```

What each one closes:

- **`BEE_UPLOADER_API_BIND`** and **`BEE_GATEWAY_API_BIND`** are the two Bee
  HTTP APIs, and neither asks for a password, so reaching one is enough to
  spend the node's postage, upload chunks and write feeds with its wallet
  behind them.
- **`SRS_HTTP_API_BIND`** is the SRS control API on 1985, which asks for no
  password either and will name every live stream, the same name an ingest URL
  and a publish key are built from, along with every publisher's and every
  viewer's address.
- **`SRS_HTTP_BIND`** is the SRS file server on 8080 and **`OME_HTTP_BIND`** is
  OME's HLS port on 8081, and both serve the finished segments, so a broadcast
  can be watched straight off the ingest host, bypassing the catalog, the
  viewer and Swarm.

Not `127.0.0.1` for the Bee ports or for OME's HLS port, and not any other
address the manager's `api` container cannot reach. The manager reaches a local
node's API and that HLS port through `host.docker.internal`, which is that same
bridge address, so loopback would cut off stamp management, and any address the
container has no route to does the same without saying so: stamp reads, postage
buys and chequebook operations stop for every deployment on this host and no
message names the cause. If the address
has to be something other than the bridge, set `BEE_LOCAL_HOST` in
`manager/.env` to that same address. That is the one override the manager reads
for it, and the stack file's own comments, which suggest a private interface
here, are only safe with it set. The two SRS ports are the exception: the
manager never reaches them, so they can go to `127.0.0.1` wherever every use of
them is a curl run on the server itself.

OME's port is worth one more line. After an engine config rollout the manager
probes it on that same address to see whether OME came back up, so a binding it
cannot reach turns a rollout that worked into a reported failure.

An ABR node pool is worth one more again, because this address leaves the
manager inside its pool string. Since 2026-09-17 the `BEE_PUBLISHERS` value a
pool hands an uploader names every rung at this same bridge address, not at the
host's public one, and that is what an uploader container on this host can
actually reach when these ports are bound here and nowhere else. `BEE_LOCAL_HOST`
overrides that too, and it is what an uploader on another machine would need,
together with a bind that admits that machine. An uploader created before
2026-09-17 still holds a string in the public form, which answers nowhere at
all. Copy the pool string from the pool page again and paste it into the
uploader's "Node pool string" field under Edit.

If this host runs the stack with `COMPOSE_NETWORK=host`, the pair that applies
to the Bee APIs is `BEE_UPLOADER_API_LISTEN` and `BEE_GATEWAY_API_LISTEN`
instead, and `*_API_BIND` does nothing there at all. The engines have no such
pair, and their three settings do nothing under host networking either, which
leaves the host firewall of step 3 to close those ports.

Commit the edit, Update the bundled version from the Versions page so the next
build captures it, then redeploy the deployments that should pick it up. A node
or an engine takes its new binding on its next deploy and not before. The
manager copies that base file fresh into each deployment's own `.env.<name>`
every time it deploys, with the deployment's own stored settings over it, so a
value set once reaches every deployment that stores no value of its own for
that key.

### 3. Generate and review the host firewall

The generator requires Node.js, this checkout's shared port policy, and a fresh
inventory export for the target. In the signed-in manager browser, open
`/targets/firewall?alias=localhost` and save the download as
`firewall-inventory.json`. Use the verified SSH alias instead of `localhost`
for a remote target, URL-encoding the alias when needed.

The export is read-only. It checks daemon identity, reservations, observed
bindings and retained immutable build contracts. It refuses unresolved jobs,
unknown owners, incomplete inventory and mutable or missing build history.
A published version is only a candidate. A retained service snapshot must be
covered by its own build contract.

With the external interface name supplied by the host operator:

```sh
./deploy/host/firewall-rules.sh --iface eth0 \
  --inventory firewall-inventory.json --max-slot 20 \
  > /tmp/manager-firewall.nft
less /tmp/manager-firewall.nft
```

The command prints a draft and applies nothing. Run it from this checkout.
The shell wrapper needs its sibling Node files and `common/src/portPolicy.js`.

Both new allocation and the generator use a maximum of 100 slots. Allocation
also honors a lower stack limit. Existing deployments keep their slots and
reservations.

Four public bands are opened, one per role: the SRT ingest on UDP, the viewer
page, and the two Bee peer ports. Each covers 100 slots. The three per-rung Bee
peer ports were bands here until 2026-09-16 and are not any more, because this
manager starts no rung service, so 297 ports that never carried a listener are
now closed like any other private port. The slot algebra still reserves them,
which costs nothing and keeps the numbering free for a version that does run
them.

An endpoint that lands on a tuple one of those bands opens causes generation to
refuse, whatever its own port variable is. It is not treated as a closed port
merely because `--max-slot` is at most 100. Fix the conflicting ownership
through the reviewed remediation process before generating another candidate.
Do not renumber a funded deployment to bypass this refusal.

The candidate replaces only the `inet streaming_infra_manager` table. It
does not clear Docker's chains or another application's tables. Its input
chain defaults to deny and permits SSH, the web edge and the supported public
stack ports. `--ssh-port` cannot exempt a port within the protected
10000 to 19999 range.

Its forward chain covers IPv4 and IPv6. On the selected external interface,
it permits supported translated public ports and drops other translated
TCP/UDP ports in the protected range. It also drops new direct routing that
has no destination translation, including direct access to container API
ports. **Review this restriction before using the candidate on a host that
also serves as a router.** Forwarding arriving on other interfaces and
unrelated translated ports outside the protected range are left to the
host's other policies. Established and related connections remain eligible.

The forward rules match the original destination port after Docker's
translation. An accept in this table does not override a later table's drop.
See the [nftables chain documentation](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Configuring_chains)
for hook ordering and verdict behavior.

The export records a capture time and database fingerprint. It is evidence
from that capture, not proof that the host has remained unchanged or that a
hand-edited file is trustworthy. Re-export after deployment, reservation or
network changes. Read-only capture cannot freeze external host changes.

Before applying a reviewed file, the operator must validate it with the
host's nftables version and review coexistence with the complete existing
ruleset. Keep the SSH session open and verify a second connection after any
operator-approved application. Persist only the manager table through the
host's existing firewall configuration. Replacing all of `/etc/nftables.conf`
could discard unrelated policy.

The Bee API bind in step 2 still closes those APIs at their published
interface. The input hook covers host listeners. The forward hook covers
published container traffic. Host-network containers with unprovable bindings
cause the inventory export to refuse.

### 4. DNS, then the domain

Point an A record at the server. Give the manager a name of its own rather than
an apex domain that also serves other things, because the edge sends an HSTS
header that covers subdomains for a year. Then in `manager/.env`:

```env
MANAGER_DOMAIN=manager.example.org
```

Deploy again. `deploy.sh` prints which of the two it is doing, and with a domain
set it adds `--profile public`, which starts the `edge` container. Watch the
first certificate arrive:

```sh
ssh manager-host
cd ~/streaming-infra-manager/manager
docker compose logs -f edge
```

Then open `https://manager.example.org` and sign in. The certificate and Caddy's
account key live in the `edge-data` volume, so recreating the container does not
ask Let's Encrypt for another one.

To go back to the tunnel alone, empty `MANAGER_DOMAIN` and deploy again. The
edge container is stopped and removed, the deploy checks that it is gone, and
the volume keeps the certificate for the next time it is switched on.

### 5. Keep the tunnel

`web` still publishes `127.0.0.1:8080`, and the tunnel still reaches it. That is
the way back in when the edge is down, the certificate is stuck or the domain is
wrong, so leave it there.

## Operations

All run on the server (`ssh manager-host`, then `cd ~/streaming-infra-manager/manager`):

```sh
docker compose ps                 # status
docker compose logs -f api        # tail manager logs
docker compose logs -f web        # tail nginx logs
docker compose restart api        # restart just the manager
docker compose down               # stop everything (postgres volume kept)
docker compose down -v            # nuke postgres data too, so be sure
```

## Architecture notes

- **`edge`** (Caddy) is the only service that publishes a port to the world:
  80, 443 and 443/udp. It exists only in the `public` compose profile, which
  `deploy.sh` adds when `MANAGER_DOMAIN` is set, so without a domain it never
  starts. Clearing the domain and deploying again stops and removes the
  container, and the deploy fails rather than finishing quietly if it is still
  running afterwards. That takes naming the profile: Compose counts a service
  whose profile is inactive as one it knows about rather than an orphan, so
  `--remove-orphans` leaves it running. It terminates TLS, gets and renews its
  own certificate, and proxies everything to `web:80`.
- **`web`** (nginx:alpine) publishes `127.0.0.1:8080` and nothing else, so it is
  reachable through the SSH tunnel and from the edge over the compose network,
  never directly from outside. It serves the built React SPA and
  reverse-proxies `/auth`, `/profiles`, `/groups`, `/health`, `/services`,
  `/config`, `/targets`, `/manager-settings`, `/versions`, `/chequebook`,
  `/metrics` and `/events` to `api:9876`. Every path the dev server proxies has
  to appear here too. A path wired in one place and not the other is how the
  whole transfer history had no route in production until 2026-09-11, and a
  test checks the two lists against each other.
- **`api`** has no published port at all. The `web` proxy on the internal
  compose network is the only thing that reaches it.
- **`postgres`** is bound to `127.0.0.1:5432` so a host-side `pnpm dev`
  (during local iteration) can connect, but it's never reachable off-host.
- The whole repo is bind-mounted into the `api` container at the same
  absolute path it has on the host (`/home/solarpunk/streaming-infra-manager`).
  This is so compose files under `manager/swarm-hls-stream/` resolve volume
  paths consistently when their `docker compose up` is forwarded to the host
  daemon via the mounted socket.
