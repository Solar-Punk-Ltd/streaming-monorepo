# T04b continuation, 2026-09-09

Status: record. The row it carries is merged into `main-v2`, and the branch was deployed on 2026-09-11. Its working instructions, branches, worktrees and line numbers were live when it was written and are not to be resumed.

## Latest boot and guard checkpoint,2026-09-09

Exact boot/legacy CAS GREEN `15c9565` is source-reviewed with5 actual SQL and3 behavioral startup cases passing. Guard `6b14265` passes9 focused cases. Neither is called fully accepted yet because manager types exposed two fixture errors, a missing contract in a PublishOutcome and a heterogeneous method-wrapper assignment. The worker is correcting them. Its separate strict-envelope regression has2 actual failures and10 controls. No runtime CLI/deploy adapter is active yet.

Before service mutation, publication admission must reject a stale already-registered pending shipment using its original expected revision, as well as rejecting stale published receipt replay. The first read must support a genuine pre024 or fresh schema through explicit read-only schema inspection. Never run migrations while the old API is still running, or translate arbitrary database errors into revision0. Worker and root agree on these adapter obligations. Existing syncBundled/publication tests must be reconciled with the explicit CLI replacement at the connected checkpoint, not silently omitted.

## Shared runtime completion contract,2026-09-09

Cross-provider review, OpenAI-hosted. Root, T01 and T04b agree on this integration seam. A prepared launch carries T01's final profile owner (instance, intent, config revision and version), exact BuildDescriptor/job reference, captured recovery artifact evidence, requested services and already-admitted DeployAttempt.id. T04b persists execution, attempt, job and launcher token before any possible spawn. It consumes that attempt without opening another attempt or taking another pre-job snapshot.

T04b exposes a durable immutable creator-completion receipt key and a transaction-local validator using the caller's PoolClient and exact execution/attempt/job/owner identities. The validator returns persisted provenance and never retires resources. A receipt proves only that the exact creator cannot create more work. A complete fresh daemon-bound observation after the receipt supplies service attribution separately. T01 commits current job container/snapshot observations and status/config lifecycle only behind exact ownership. Initial RUNNING/afterRunning starts any required engine watch. It does not release operation holds. Primary ancestry release waits for the owned applied/reverted terminal result, complete required-service coverage and the full healthy watch. An uncertain or interrupted watch retains all operation holds.

Shared lock order is allocation, daemon, sorted versions, profile, operations/references, then exact execution/attempt receipt rows. T04b audits every writer taking both when implementing030. No mismatch was found with the accepted read-only observer, which grants no cleanup permission. This contract permits caller wiring now. It is not evidence that runtime launch, completion or release is implemented.

## Current boundary, 2026-09-09

**Connected publication approvals:** boot RED `9033b36` reproduces timestamp orphan adoption, unregistered incoming consumption and recreation of missing legacy files. Implement the complete publication CLI/deploy/boot flow with synthetic shims. No real scripts, builds, pulls, SSH or host operations run.

The manager upgrade guard is durable and host-local, outside mutable rsync destinations and prune payloads. It covers every manager project mutation, including active source/config installation, API, web and edge. Unique source staging may happen outside it. Record shipment ID, exact manager image/source identity, Compose project and phase. Retain uncertain ownership. No clock/PID-only stealing or uncertain same-ID relaunch. Under the guard, compare the receipt/publication revision with the current publication before any service mutation. This rejects stale A even after C completed and released the guard. Hold the fence through startup verification. All production publication entrypoints honor the same guard. Tests pause A while C attempts zero mutations, then complete C and replay stale A with zero mutations. This is separate from profile admission and needs no migration by itself.

Legacy boot metadata refresh uses a version-row compare-and-swap, not the upgrade guard, because the API boots while upgrade verification still holds that guard. Capture a dedicated internal DTO with the existing bigint publication_revision, exact legacy identity and prior metadata. Read files outside the transaction without bootstrap/default writes, preserving SHLS_ROOT fallback. Under the version lock, update only the unchanged still-legacy row at the captured revision. Refuse after B publication, a competing refresh or A→B→A. Metadata is not artifact verification. Tests cover valid initialization, paused read→B publication→refusal with whole-row preservation, revision change, actual lock waiting and caller mutation. No new migration is needed. Five-case SQL RED precedes the source patch.

Observation GREEN `a793f97910b3f6388d5cc3c09185443b1e180091` follows RED `324a7b9`. It passes 36 helper cases, one actual SQL case and manager types in `/private/tmp/t04b-observation-{unit-green,sql-green,types}.log`. Root reviewed source and tests. Acceptance awaits a separate parent/ancestor bind regression: a container mounting the execution parent or an ancestor can access multiple registered copies. The first helper finds only mounts at or below one execution root. Record every dependent copy while keeping provenance separate. Direct source-artifact mounts remain unmatched evidence in this execution-copy helper, requiring separate artifact retention during later integration. No observation grants cleanup authority.

**Accepted correction:** RED `8a507cb` reproduced both ancestor cases with 21 controls. GREEN `aa360e8d2b1845ebc13e084137d98bf8e286c5d3` passes 40 capture/attribution checks and final manager types. Logs `/private/tmp/t04b-ancestor-bind-{red,green,types}.log`. Root reviewed exact source, tests and logs and accepts the observation boundary including the earlier one actual SELECT SQL case. No SQL rerun was needed for the attribution-only correction.

The next complete flow is bundled package publication/activation through the CLI and deployment wiring, using the accepted shipment design and synthetic command shims. Immutable runtime execution and observed retirement still follow. T01 owns final configuration/job/operation lifecycle. No real deployment, build, image pull or host command is authorized.

**Implementation approved:** merge exact T04a `c55c9d93b17b75619b239104099de28cdfff2a43` into this task branch first. Report substantive merge conflicts for review. Preserve removal markers and accepted observation/package/journal behavior. Then test and implement the connected shipment preparation, CLI, deployment ordering and boot behavior. Use `Database.migrate` serialization and the accepted claim/journal/materializer. A retry returns its durable receipt before consulting a removed package. Build and run the publication command from the exact new manager image in the generated deployment flow. Stop only the old manager API and preserve managed containers and legacy bytes. No timestamp or unregistered incoming-directory adoption. Publication never prunes. Failed/incomplete reconciliation gates pruning. All execution tests use synthetic command shims and owned SQL. Review at the connected flow checkpoint, with one logical fix per commit.

**Merge review and validation:** root approved the conflict union in PostgresExecutionRootRepository, incoming versionRemovalProblem under the version lock followed by the existing full active-job profile SELECT/type/predicate. Exact `f5a02ca` versionRemoval.test.ts fixtures are reused. The four-file SQL run on61175 finished naturally at136/139, with three buildJobOwnership setup failures before assertions. Log `/private/tmp/t04b-t04a-merge-sql.log`. Removal47 and all execution/snapshot cases passed. No signal was sent or case interrupted. Former session33685 and PIDs76561/83895 are gone. No t04b_test activity remains, so no specific leftover blocker was proven. Retain schema `t04b_owned_job_b26fbf6c27e02114`. Merge types pass in `/private/tmp/t04b-t04a-merge-types.log`. Unchanged buildJobOwnership then passed26/26 in `/private/tmp/t04b-t04a-merge-ownership-rerun.log`. Root accepts exact merge `67051e8eff399e9c294274fd75fcdf45f3427f45`. No timeout increase or production relaxation. Do not repeat unchanged passing merge checks. A later boot gate must treat skipped, null and unmatched observations as incomplete, not merely check that void observeAll returned without throwing. Reuse T09's low-level owned transport where applicable instead of adding another SSH lifecycle. Migration030 is reserved for later execution/launcher lifecycle if needed. T01 owns029.

The T11 worker `implement_t12_readiness` now owns the existing `/private/tmp/t04b-codex` from clean `58eb319` for an approved tests-first observation helper slice. T11 remains clean and accepted at `ef269a8`. This supersedes the unassigned-tree statement below. No dependency merge or new migration is part of this first slice. Use only its own retained 61175 synthetic database for the one SELECT regression. The 62527 fixture belongs to T01.

New `executionMountCapture` uses an injected reader and bounded monotonic deadline to inspect all containers on the expected daemon, across every project and state. Repeat daemon/list checks and reject incomplete, malformed, oversized, changed or failed reads as unknown. The future real reader needs one acquired daemon-bound transport. This helper does not establish that property for the old target adapter, and a double list is not proof no creator exists.

New `executionMountAttribution` maps exact validated registered roots and working directories to persisted execution/source identities. Inspect bind sources for dependencies on any registered execution, including foreign projects, stopped containers and multiple roots. Separate registered provenance from proof of job creation. Keep unknown/ambiguous results and every matching container. Do not derive build identity from a pathname or use the first container only. A no-match result never grants cleanup permission. Clone inputs before asynchronous work. Add SELECT-only `listUnreleased`, including deleted-profile records and resolved jobs while excluding released executions.

Tests cover A's registered execution after B publication, multiple/stopped/foreign containers, E1 working directory with E2 binds, missing labels, unregistered/lookalike/traversal paths, malformed registry identities, daemon change, incomplete inventory, deadlines, cancellation and caller mutation. No existing observer caller is replaced and no job, snapshot, hold, launcher or file is changed by these helpers.

Later retirement requires a durable execution/attempt/launcher-token association and immutable completion receipt proving that exact creator can no longer create work. Existing job/attempt labels and ScriptRunner child exit do not establish the remote creator fact. A complete observation must follow the receipt. Copying or launch-uncertain records without proof remain retained after restart. Deleting must commit before payload removal, preserve holds across failures, and release only the exact execution hold afterward. Root reviews these later mutation boundaries separately. T01 continues to own operation lifecycle and successful job finalization.

Cross-provider review, OpenAI-hosted. The T04b worktree is left clean at `58eb319`, including accepted initial/preparation failure fence `ec46edc`. All 191 SQL checks and types pass. Manager 961/963 has the two known T01 split-caller failures. Exact T04b is now merged into T01 and T11. T01 owns the atomic operation/claim and lifecycle work, with repository seam `0f7d6ba` and exact T04a dependency `068bc85` accepted. T11 carries exact T04a/T04b through `f5a02ca` and is fixing its settings write. Neither dependency merge activates T04b private runtime copies.

The remaining T04b work is observed execution retirement/restart, exact mounted-root attribution, immutable runtime preparation across deploy/stop/remove/health, unique remote execution transport and the shipment CLI. New runtime callers must preserve T04a's removal-marker checks. They must consume the final T01 job/operation ownership rather than recreating the earlier reserve-then-begin gap. Legacy roots need proven immutable capture before automatic recovery can use them. The operation descriptor's full-tree artifact digest must use the same canonical format as ExecutionSource/copyExecutionRoot.

The retained 62527 fixture is now owned by the T01 worker, not an idle T04b task. Do not clean or reuse it without that owner coordinating. No new worker is assigned to this T04b tree yet. Older assignments and pending-fix statements below are historical.

## Core job producer accepted after quota resume

Cross-provider review, OpenAI-hosted. Core `b4c0eb9` is accepted after separate-tree source and SQL regression review. Logs confirm 177 actual SQL checks, 963 manager checks and workspace types. Active job migration 027 fences duplicate initial claims and same-intent successors.

The separate failure-fence RED is committed at `5610a94`. Its implementation passes 14 focused actual SQL/orchestrator checks and workspace types, but full manager checks currently pass 961 of 963. The two `engineConfigCreationGuard` tests expose the already identified T01 reservation-to-operation revision mismatch. This is an incomplete integration checkpoint, not a green branch. Keep the strict guard and fix the transaction boundary.

The worker resumes the separate initial/preparation failure-write correction. A refused duplicate initial request currently reaches a name-only error write and can mark the winning job failed. Require captured instance, intent, config revision, version and exact active reference, including NULL before a job exists. Preserve pointer and historical holds. The core claim acceptance does not close this caller gap or the later T01 operation transaction and hold lifecycle.

## Next T01 integration review boundary

Root read the current engine configuration service and repository during the resumed review. `rollOut` reserves a job, reads the previous config by name, then calls `operations.begin` in another transaction. `begin` checks only config revision and advances intent, leaving the job reference on the earlier intent. A same-name replacement with the same revision can also receive that write. `beginRevert` changes config revision after its job is reserved. These are known integration gaps, not approval to weaken job ownership.

After the initial/preparation error fence, the worker must propose the final atomic transaction for job identity, config, operation and rollback target. Previous config must come from the owned locked row. A previously committed job must never be retagged. If a provisional reservation is retained, any final job must be a fresh reference installed only after exact unlaunched reservation proof, with failure leaving all unrelated holds intact. Port and creation-guard refusal must still occur before recovery restores the previous file. Operation holds need explicit instance identity and a release rule for every terminal or interrupted state. Keep historical ambiguous holds conservative. Successful completion is also still open: deploy snapshots, mount observation, config cleanup, the RUNNING write and afterRunning hook must not act on a successor. T10's accepted terminal-event latch must be integrated before claiming one finalizer.

The implementation belongs on T01's task branch after an exact accepted T04b dependency merge. No design or implementation is yet accepted for this boundary.

## Current accepted execution helpers and next producer

Cross-provider review, OpenAI-hosted. Execution repository `cd89978` and private file copy `4b0d32b` are accepted. Root reviewed source, migration025 and deterministic races. Thirty new SQL,17 file,140 total SQL and947 manager cases plus types pass. Logs `/private/tmp/t04b-execution-{repository-green,files-green,final-sql,final-unit,final-types}.log`.

Registration freezes descriptor identity, validates source version/profile instance/intent/status/target/job and adds its own source hold. Copying and launch-uncertain states retain holds. Only registered/ready unstarted copies can be claimed for cleanup. Private writable copies are exclusive and reverified, with ownership metadata outside the writable tree. Historical NULL job ownership cannot authorize execution. These helpers are not caller activation.

T12 merge `3d38b76` and fixture correction `a7d4145` report963 manager/151 SQL/289 common/18 frontend and workspace types. Root merge review is accepted. The core owned job producer is now accepted at `b4c0eb9`. Its preparation-error fence remains in progress. Its claim transaction must return final ownership and insert the job at that same instance/intent. Normal operator actions advance intent once. Automatic recovery preserves its intent. Initial describe validates the inserted DEPLOYING identity.

Migration027 is reserved for an exact active job-reference discriminator on profiles. It prevents stale cancellation or an old ready execution from acting after a successor with the same preserved intent. Compare that pointer, instance, intent and status during cancellation and every execution ownership check. Historical NULL stays NULL. Clearing the pointer never releases independent artifact holds.

Later separate changes remain required: T01 operation begin/revert and operation-hold lifecycle, T04a guarded version removal before file deletion, T10 instance-scoped operation-hold integration, observed execution retirement/restart, exact mounted-root attribution, immutable runtime preparation, unique remote execution transport and shipment CLI. Current reserveForRollout then operations.begin is still a two-transaction intent gap. Never retag its committed job or claim rollout execution is complete.

The worker owns retained synthetic database285c10f9...badbe9a at62527. No real script, engine image, remote host or build has run.

## Earlier checkpoints, superseded where noted above

## Latest accepted materializer checkpoint

The next bounded execution-copy design is approved. T01 dependency `cff0f07` merged as `a8ad08d`, with930 manager/288 common/110 SQL and types passing. Execution RED `05eaa4a` adds repository and file tests. They currently fail because the modules are missing, so new SQL assertions have not yet run. Migration025 is reserved to execution records and nullable explicit instance/intent fields on job references, without inferred backfill. Unowned historical holds remain protective but cannot authorize a new execution.

Root reviewed both RED files and approved GREEN with deterministic cleanup/launch controls and refusal after changed intent/status/daemon/job ownership. Registration holds the version row, validates profile and explicit job ownership, and creates a durable source hold. Private UUID execution copies keep metadata outside the writable tree. Copying and launch-uncertain states retain holds and refuse unstarted cleanup. Production job-reference ownership and intent ordering, observed retirement/restart recovery, operation references and generic version removal all remain caller prerequisites. The stack's fixed remote rsync directory also requires a separate target transport design. No caller, real script, build, image qualification or host operation is part of this helper slice.

Cross-provider review, OpenAI-hosted. Root accepted clean `2dd79d4` after reviewing the installer and all18 actual PostgreSQL/file cases. Full110 SQL and900 manager tests pass, with no skips, plus types. Logs `/private/tmp/t04b-materializer-{red,green,types,final-sql,final-unit,final-types}.log`. Preceding accepted checkpoints are prune `bcf8c38`, migration admission `d6a18e3`, exact metadata `764fce1` and complete artifact-file verification `a31794e`.

The materializer starts from a pre-reserved candidate. Each invocation copies into its own exclusive directory. Preparation durably selects one finished copy and its full final digest. Retries use that selected copy or the verified final directory. Missing selected and final paths refuse. Existing destinations are not overwritten. Full verification stays outside the short version/shipment row-lock installation boundary. Activation remains the separate existing journal operation. Receipt replay comes before package or artifact reads, including A/B/C publication and pruning.

Reuse requires a previously published journal-backed artifact with its recorded final digest and exact metadata. The verified incoming commit and complete input hashes must agree with its actual old bytes. A different generation alone is allowed when the hashes agree. Pre-journal artifacts remain unchanged for existing deployments. A newly verified artifact is materialized when their equivalence cannot be proved.

CLI and runtime immutability remain open. The worker next proposes a design for running the existing root-writing stack scripts while preserving the immutable artifact. A private execution copy must have durable source-build/profile/job ownership, correct mounted-root observation and restart/prune behavior. Moving only the manager env writer is insufficient. No stack contract extension, real engine build or host action is authorized by this checkpoint.

Cross-provider review, OpenAI-hosted. Worktree `/private/tmp/t04b-codex`, branch `fix/t04b-bundled-builds`. Journal activation is accepted at `7c35588`, following helpers `e8996d3` and revision foundation `1861365`. The worker now implements actual pruning coordination in a separate RED/GREEN checkpoint. Verify its current tree before editing.

Levi explicitly approved the reviewer-only override for remaining agreed local work, including worktrees, source/test edits, commits and disposable local tests. No push, main-v2 merge, GitHub write, host access, real image build or image pull is included. Earlier automatic-review blocks were resolved by that answer. Do not repeat the permission question.

## Accepted capture

The reviewed T06 dependency merge is `f2bffa6`. Initial helper RED `f60a29b` failed because the module did not yet exist. Boundary RED `f8be14f` reproduced four actual failures against the first implementation, with 22 passing controls. GREEN `5c58cfa` closes direct/ancestor aliasing, private revision-manifest symlink writes and composed symbolic-link escapes.

- `exportPinnedBundledSource(source, destination, commandAdapter?)` resolves one commit and exports its Git objects into a new private tree. Submodules use their recorded gitlink commits. Dirty application paths refuse export. Executable modes and valid internal links are preserved. Link graph expansion processes each link before any subsequent parent traversal.
- `captureBundledInputs(source, destination, options?)` captures one committed host-input revision under the existing lock and replaces the complete input set only in a separate private tree. Input paths/hashes are validated. The revision manifest is replaced exclusively and written last. No source configuration is changed by capture.
- A source without a committed revision requires the existing explicit adoption step in later entrypoint wiring. Capture does not invent a revision. Current production callers retain their original default capture behavior.

Validation: 51 focused tests, 850 manager tests, 280 common tests, manager/common types and diff checks pass. Logs `/private/tmp/t04b-source-boundary-{red,green,types}.log` and `/private/tmp/t04b-capture-final-{unit,common,common-types}.log`. Root independently reviewed source and evidence. No deployment caller was changed.

## Accepted package sealing and verification

GREEN `49667b8` follows RED `ba4c7b9`. All 56 focused capture/package/input tests and manager types pass. Logs `/private/tmp/t04b-package-{red,green,types}.log`. Root independently reviewed the package, inventory, path helper and tests. Canonical payload binds shipment, full commit, complete copied-input identity, root mode and sorted path/type/mode/content inventory. The manifest is excluded from its own inventory and only its digest field is excluded from payload hashing. Manifest mode is fixed at0600. Source changes while sealing refuse. Verification reads the whole owned tree, not only its manifest. Caller-exclusive ownership and a stopped builder are explicit preconditions.

## Accepted exclusive claim

Claim GREEN `e8996d3` follows RED `f0166c2`. The new-module RED was an import failure, not an individually executed behavioral failure. GREEN proves one-winner races with shared and separate claim paths, refusal of existing claim ownership, exact empty-directory cleanup after missing ready input, complete expected identity before ownership, root-link refusal and retention of a failed verification. Final checks passed 78 focused, 877 manager, 53 actual PostgreSQL and 280 common tests. Manager/frontend types pass. Common types passed at the capture checkpoint. Logs `/private/tmp/t04b-package-claim-{red,green,types}.log` and `/private/tmp/t04b-helpers-final-{unit,sql,common,frontend-types}.log`. Root independently reviewed source, regressions and final evidence.

## Historical helper plan

Implement exclusive claim in a separate RED/GREEN checkpoint. Sealing and verification are accepted above. Use synthetic files only. Root reviews these before migration024, shipment CLI or deploy wiring.

- Seal a privately built tree into a unique owned output directory. Record deterministic path, type, mode and content inventory, exact source commit and complete input identity. Define the manifest digest's self-exclusion rule explicitly.
- Verify the entire claimed package against the expected shipment/commit/digest identity. Detect additions, removals and mode/type/content changes. Refuse source changes during sealing and external-link traversal.
- Claim by reserving a fresh private claim directory, then atomically moving the ready package into its payload child before reading it. Competing claims have one winner. Never overwrite a destination or reuse only a manifest's identity.

Later accepted shipment design is in ACCEPTANCE-AUDIT. It uses a durable shipment record and monotonic publication revision. Record candidate identity before final rename. Activation and its receipt share a database transaction. Recover an old publication receipt without reactivating that build after a later publication. Keep pending artifacts from pruning. The database build row selects code and captured inputs together. Retain the stable rootPath convention and add no admission lock.

Migration024 is reserved for that later slice and has not been written at the capture checkpoint. The first-upgrade CLI must run from the new manager image, not the old API container. Only command-shim tests are authorized here. Real builds, image pulls, SSH and deployments remain excluded.

The worker also owns the retained synthetic database `285c10f9f8ae41c877fb54fe88f53e2ec3b8bb9ae3808872c02cee74bbadbe9a`, loopback62527. Other workers must not clean it. The funded review deployment remains untouched.

## Current next slice

Propose migration024 and the durable journal/activation repository before tests and implementation. Root requested exact registration identity, monotonic publication revision, candidate assignment before rename, transactional activation receipt, replay after later publication and stale/unregistered artifact refusal. Keep this persistence slice separate from CLI/deploy wiring.

Later integration must define the final build manifest and complete marker without weakening sealed inventory checks. Check that ordinary version publish writers cannot change bundled active identity without fencing or advancing its publication revision. Also audit `DeploymentOrchestrator.ensureStackDefaults`: an activated immutable artifact must not be rewritten or have deliberately absent captured inputs recreated. These caller obligations are not part of the accepted helper checkpoint.

## Approved persistence slice

Migration024 adds decimal-string `publication_revision` and `bundled_shipments`. Shipment identity is a write-once UUID/version/package digest/commit/original expected revision. Candidate ID and exact generated build metadata are recorded before final rename. Candidate identity and prepared final-artifact digest cannot be reassigned. Published receipt and active row change commit in one transaction. Every writer locks version before shipment. There is no new deployment admission lock.

Root approved a revision trigger that advances once when the active tuple changes and rejects arbitrary jumps/regressions. Explicit publication increments also fence a same-artifact publication. Tested/default/error-only metadata changes do not advance revision. Tests cover direct tuple writers as well as generic publish/markBuilt.

Full candidate verification runs outside the version-row transaction. Durable pending-candidate protection and immutable ownership retain its bytes during that scan. Activation then locks and rereads exact identity, candidate digest/state and the original publication revision. If C publishes while A verifies, A becomes superseded. Verification must not block a deployment claim behind a long filesystem scan. A published receipt is returned without requiring old files. If a duplicate invocation publishes during another verifier and a newer publication removes A's files, the failing verifier rechecks for A's durable receipt and returns it without changing C.

The second artifact digest covers every final path/type/mode/content, including the original shipment manifest and exact generated `.stack-manifest.json` and `.complete`. Intake digest remains unchanged. No arbitrary file exclusion is added. Candidate metadata is fixed before materialization, including build ID, timestamp and toolchain. Reuse compares complete input hashes and source commit, never generation alone.

Pending shipment candidates have a separate reader added to pruning's existing version lock. They are not profile-operation references. Registration/reservation and pruning share the lock order. Activation does not prune. Caller adoption/recovery and failed-observer retention are separate later regressions.

Required SQL cases include identity replay/conflict, original expectation retained after C, one activation winner, transactional receipt rollback, lost acknowledgment recovery after later publication, stale pending supersession, reassignment refusal, candidate holds in both prune lock orders, absent-record refusal and revision writer coverage. Synthetic verifier gates additionally test nonblocking admission and concurrent duplicate receipt recovery.

## Later immutable-runtime caller gap

Root and worker confirmed `bootstrapStackDefaults` recreates `.env` and `deploy/config.json`, and `prepareReservedJob` writes `.env.<profile>` inside the selected artifact. Later caller wiring must preserve deliberately absent captured files and move mutable per-profile runtime files outside sealed artifact content. Cover deploy, stop, health and claim-refusal paths. This remains within the bundled immutable-artifact integration obligation and is not fixed by the accepted helpers or the new persistence slice.

The stack also fixes `ROOT_DIR` from the script location in `_lib.sh`, creates `engines/<engine>/.env.<profile>` and writes `deploy/.env.deploy.<profile>`. Deploy may build absent uploader output. Moving only the manager's env writer will not preserve immutable artifacts. A later design must account for the script contract and ledger mount-root identity. No stack change or runtime-copy approach is approved yet.

## Accepted publication revision foundation

RED `c6fe727` reproduced eight actual SQL failures. GREEN `1861365` passes all eight new and all61 inherited/new SQL cases, plus manager types. Root reviewed the trigger, repository writer changes and tests. Logs `/private/tmp/t04b-publication-revision-{red,green,sql,types}.log`. Migration024 currently contains the counter/trigger foundation. Its not-yet-deployed journal portion is active work on the same branch.

The synthetic database list now includes `t04b_test`, using `T04B_TEST_PG_PORT=62527` on the worker's retained container. T20 must include the publicationRevision test and later shipment suites, with preflight that refuses absent configuration rather than silently accepting skipped SQL tests.

A separate later CLI prerequisite remains migration-run serialization. `Database.migrate` currently creates/checks the ledger outside a common lock and can race a second one-off CLI. Serialize initial ledger creation, migration admission and seen checks on one dedicated connection. Preserve per-migration rollback and release correctly. Test concurrent fresh migrators and failed migration retry before CLI acceptance.

## Accepted shipment journal

GREEN `7c35588` follows initial RED `c62a3c7` and actual follow-up REDs `89562ef` and `8384983`. All 23 real SQL tests pass, comprising15 shipment cases and8 publication revision cases. Manager types pass. Logs `/private/tmp/t04b-journal-green-final.log` and `/private/tmp/t04b-journal-green-final-types.log`. Root independently reviewed the migration, repository, shared publication assignment and complete test suite.

Registration pins the UUID, version ID, package digest, source commit, original expected revision and root anchor. Candidate metadata and prepared artifact digest cannot be reassigned. New materialization refuses a prior reservation of either kind. Activation checks the registered version, verifies outside SQL locks, then commits the active reference and receipt atomically. Tests cover two competing publications, unchanged replay after C, rollback of failed receipt storage, lost commit acknowledgment, stale candidates before verification and duplicate-verifier recovery after A then C. Resolved receipts need no surviving artifact. No filesystem materializer, CLI or deployment caller is wired yet.

The next checkpoint tests the real prune path with version locking in both orders and pending candidates held separately from deployment references. Final materialization must still verify complete captured-input metadata and final artifact bytes. Repository typing alone does not establish those facts.
