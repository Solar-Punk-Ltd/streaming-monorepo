# Stack versions

A stack version identifies the streaming software and deployment contract used by a deployment. It is more than a branch name. The manager records the selected version, its published build and the build observed for each service.

Status, 2026-09-16. Everything on this page is merged to `main-v2`. It was written at `6dc33d1` on `feat/ai-remediation`, the head of pull request #40, which landed, and `main-v2` has moved a long way past it since. It carries the 22 remediation task heads, the bundled version fetched and built on the host from the commit the manager pins, a settings page for each version's own files, the build tree cloning that Apply uses, and the database migrations, which stood at 031 when this was written and are at 038 today. Combined acceptance is not complete. The branch has been deployed twice, on 2026-09-11 and 2026-09-13, and what those passes found is in [../handover/main-v2-remediation.md](../handover/main-v2-remediation.md). This document describes the design rather than the state of any particular host. Corrected 2026-09-17 against the code at `0c0354c`: the section on the tree a deployment runs in.

## Selecting a version

New standalone deployments and groups choose a version in the wizard. The default supplies the initial choice when it is available. If there is no available default, the operator must choose explicitly, even when only one other version is available.

A version list arriving late must leave a usable selector visible. A later default change does not overwrite an explicit choice or discard the draft. If the selected version disappears, the operator chooses again.

Decision D6 from the engine-configuration discussion on 2026-09-07 applies: version selection is for new deployments. Moving an existing deployment or group to another version is outside this agreed set. There is no promised Move version control or move-version API.

Updating a version does not automatically restart its existing deployments. The published build and the build currently running are separate facts.

## Versions page

The Versions page shows the bundled version and registered versions. Each card exposes the version name, ref, commit, build state, default and Tested state, with details that expand for the contract and build information. Actions remain accessible at narrow widths.

- Add registers a ref and starts its build. The build log reports progress and failures.
- Update fetches and builds the selected ref. On the bundled version it builds the commit the manager pins, and it moves that version's ref onto the pin, so a rebuild after a manager deploy follows the new pin rather than the old one. A failed update keeps a previously usable build available and records the failure. A version without a usable build remains failed.
- Settings opens the page for that version's own files. It is disabled for a version that has not finished a build on this host, and for a version that still deploys from a flat checkout, and the button says which of the two applies.
- Tested records an operator's approval of the displayed artifact. It does not run a test suite or prove live playback.
- Set as default controls the wizard's initial choice. A version must be Tested before it can become the default.
- Remove refuses the bundled version, the default, a building version, any version assigned to a deployment, and any version retained by jobs, observations, operations or execution roots. The refusal explains what still retains it.

Only one build runs at a time on a host. Add, Update and Apply each take the same mutex, and a second one is refused while the first is going, naming the version that holds it.

Adding a version executes that repository's build and deployment code with the manager's capabilities. The operator must trust the selected source.

## Tested and default are separate

For an immutable build, approval names both the displayed commit and build id. The database checks those identities, the layout and Ready status in the same write. A stale page cannot approve a different build of the same commit. Missing immutable identity disables approval.

A legacy row retains commit-bound approval only while it is explicitly legacy and has no build id. It cannot retain that compatibility behavior after publication changes its layout.

When an update changes the approved artifact, approval is cleared. If that version was the default, it stays the default. The wizard shows that it is no longer marked as tested, with the recorded date when an update removed approval. This is decision D07. No historical date is invented. Reapproval and manual withdrawal clear the update-invalidation date.

Repeating publication of the identical approved artifact does not arbitrarily remove approval. A distinct rebuild has a distinct identity and requires its own approval.

## Published builds and retained roots

Under `STACK_VERSIONS_ROOT`, a registered version uses sibling paths:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `<name>.repo/` | The source clone used to prepare builds |
| `<name>.builds/<build-id>/` | A published application tree |
| `<name>.builds/tmp-<attempt>/` | One attempt's unpublished staging tree |
| `<name>.builds/<build-id>.inventory.json` | What that build was read to be, hashed once, so a deployment's copy proves it by a stat walk |
| `<name>/` | Host-owned configuration and the retained legacy root |
| `.executions/<execution-id>/tree/` | One deployment's private copy of the build it is running, with `owner.json` and `ready.json` beside it |

A published build carries `.stack-manifest.json` and a `.complete` marker written last. Its identity includes the commit and build id. A build of the same commit and captured inputs can reuse the existing complete artifact. A distinct rebuild receives an identity such as `<commit>-r1`. Published application payloads are not replaced in place.

A saved setting reaches a deployment only through a build that captured it, and fetching and building the stack again for one changed line takes minutes. So **Apply** on the settings page publishes another build of the same commit instead: the current build's tree with the settings files replaced by the committed revision, a fresh build id, the old manifest's commit and toolchain kept, and the revision's generation and hashes recorded. The unchanged files are hard linked, because a published build is never written to again, and a link falls back to a copy where the filesystem refuses one. A link in the source tree is recreated as a link rather than followed. The deployment's own env file is copied rather than linked, because a deploy truncates it in place and a link would write the new build's values into the build every running deployment reads. When a build of that commit already carries that revision, Apply answers that build and publishes nothing.

The database row is the active reference. Publication updates it atomically and retains the previous build. There is no new build catalogue to manage, following D08.

A deployment captures its build before running scripts. The agreed admission rule validates the selected snapshot under the version-row lock and records a job reference before the build can be pruned. A changed, missing or incomplete selected artifact causes a refusal. It must not silently switch to a newer build or fall back to the bundled checkout. A legitimate legacy bundled row remains distinct from a missing version row.

Pruning protects the current and previous builds, unresolved jobs, observed service references and open operations that still need a build. A failed script or unavailable container observation does not prove that a reference can be released. The legacy root is retained and is not an ancestor of the immutable build directories.

Removing a registered version rechecks its exact identity and every hold while locking its database row. File cleanup starts only after those checks pass. Before deleting payloads, the manager durably writes a sibling `<name>.removal.json` marker. A crash or partial cleanup leaves that marker in place, so a retained database row cannot make a partially deleted build deployable again. Updates, deployment admission and execution registration refuse that marked version.

Retrying removal of the same version can finish the cleanup. The marker remains after successful removal. A later registration of the same name is allowed only when the marker is valid and belongs to an older version ID. Unreadable, malformed, active or future-ID markers cause a refusal. Configured paths must remain inside the verified physical versions directory.

## Host configuration and runtime files

Every version keeps three kinds of file the operator owns, in `<name>/`: the base `.env`, `deploy/config.json` and one `.env` per engine the version ships a sample for. The supported configuration-edit path, `manager/scripts/stack-config-edit.sh`, commits them as one revision under a shared advisory lock. Individual files are replaced atomically and the revision manifest, containing their hashes, is written last.

A version's first build seeds those files from the samples in the build tree, so an added version starts with the stack's own defaults. Then every env file is completed from the sample of the version being built: the sample's own line for each key the file lacks, appended in the sample's order, committed as one more revision. A key the operator already assigned keeps its bytes, and a value the sample leaves blank stays blank. The bundled version has one extra step before both, described below.

Build or job capture takes the same lock and validates the captured inputs against that revision. An incomplete edit produces a bounded refusal instead of a mixture of old and new inputs. A root without a revision manifest is adopted from its current inputs before later captures use it.

These files carry the stream passphrase, the API token, the webhook token and the Bee passphrase, so a file the manager writes into a config root or into a build is owner only, and a file it replaces keeps the mode an operator gave it. Every path of the set is checked for links before it is read, and what was passed by is logged.

Per-profile runtime files are written atomically for the deployment. They are distinct from the immutable application identity. No credential is returned in the version list or printed as build evidence. The settings page below is the one route that answers these values, and the manager logs key names only.

## The tree a deployment runs in

A deploy does not run in the build. It copies the build it was admitted on into a directory of its own under `.executions`, registered against the job reference the claim already took, and runs the stack's scripts there. So the bootstrapped `.env` and `deploy/config.json`, the deployment's own `.env.<profile>`, and the `engines/<engine>/.env.<profile>` and `deploy/.env.deploy.<profile>` the stack's scripts write all land in that copy, and a published build keeps the bytes it was verified as however many deployments run from it. Two deployments of one build no longer share one tree. Stop, health and remove run in the same copy, because the compose files, the scripts and that env file are all there.

The copy's files are the build's own files, hard linked rather than written again, the same way one build is cloned from another. A published build is never written to again, and the files a deployment writes into its copy are ones the build does not have, so the two can share the bytes of everything else. A copy of the real stack tree therefore costs the disk a few kilobytes of directories rather than another 432 MB, and the wait before a deploy's first script is a walk of the tree rather than a write of every byte in it. A file the filesystem will not link, because the versions root sits on another volume from the builds, gets its bytes copied instead, so such a host still deploys.

The copy is exact either way, and since 2026-09-17 it is proved without reading the build again. A build is read and sha256-hashed once, the first time anything copies it, into a record beside its directory named `<build-id>.inventory.json`, owner only. That record holds the tree digest and, for every path in the build, its type, its mode, the digest of a file, the target of a link, and a stamp of the device, inode, mode, size and modification time. Before the links are made and again after them, the build is proved against that record by a stat walk rather than by its bytes, so a build that moves under the copy is still refused rather than run. The finished copy is then proved by identity: a device and inode equal to the record's says the copy holds the very file the record stamped, and the stat walk of the build is what says that file still holds the bytes that were hashed. A linked path that is no longer that inode is refused. Only the files the copy owns outright are read and hashed against the record, which is the settings files, every file on a host whose filesystem refuses the link, and a path no stamp map can keep, which is a file named `__proto__`. Where the link is refused, that means every file of the build is read on every deploy, so a versions root and an executions root on different volumes give up the saving entirely. A build published before this existed has no record and gets one on its first deploy, which says so in the log, so there is nothing to do by hand. On the live host the old reading cost 117 seconds per deployment, and the four members of one pool waited 8 minutes 21 seconds for 32 seconds of deploy script.

What the stamp leaves out is deliberate. The status-change time is the one field left out of the full stamp the manager takes elsewhere, because making a hard link to a file moves it without touching a byte and the copy links every file of the build, so a recorded one would stop matching the moment the next deploy ran. The link count moves the same way and has never been in a stamp, so it is not compared either.

Since 2026-09-19, that rule also applies while a published build or a linked execution copy is being inventoried. A regular file is held to its device, inode, type, mode, size and modification time across the read. Directories, symbolic links, path membership and link targets keep their strict checks. The manifest is parsed from the bytes read under that identity rather than by reopening its path. This allows another deployment or manager process to create or remove a hard link at the same time without turning that metadata-only change into a failed deployment. Inside one manager process, simultaneous cold inventories of the same build share one hash operation. All waiters see a shared failure, and a later call starts a fresh attempt because completed and rejected work is not cached in memory.

Three things follow, and they are limits rather than defects. The stamps do not detect a writer who changes a file of a published build and then puts its size, mode and modification time back, and that writer already has write access to the versions root, where they can replace the build outright. After a build's first deploy nothing reads its bytes again, so a byte that rots on disk under it is not noticed by the copy and does not move a stamp. And a write through one of the copy's linked paths after the build's last stat walk, a window of milliseconds inside a directory that is owner only and that nothing has been started from yet, reaches the build through the shared inode without the copy seeing it.

A record is only believed while it describes the build under it. One that does not parse, names another build, whose digest does not describe its own entries, whose stamps and entries do not name the same paths or disagree about one of them, or whose stamp of the build root is not the directory that is there now, is treated as absent and taken again. That last one is what a rebuild at the same build id gets, which is what a rollback to a pruned commit is. Prune takes a build's record with the build, and a record left by an earlier prune is swept when the next one is written.

Preparing a copy says which build it is copying and how many files that is, and a copy of more than five hundred files says ten lines about its progress while it links them, so a deployment of the real tree is no longer silent between the line that starts it and the line that ends it.

The directories are owner only. The engines do mount out of the copy: the SRS compose file mounts its config template, its entrypoint and its healthcheck, and the OME one mounts its Server.xml template and its entrypoint, all five read only. Read only is what makes that safe, and it matters more now than it did, because those files are hard links of the build's own inodes. A mount of the same shape that could be written would write the published build through the link, and every later deploy of that build would then be refused against its record. A version that keeps no immutable builds gets no copy and runs from its flat tree as it always did.

A copy is recorded as launched before anything can be spawned from it, and from that moment only its own deployment moving on retires it. Levi's decision D11 sets how many are kept: the copy a deployment is running from and the one before it, so a deploy that fails leaves the tree that last worked in place, and a deploy that comes up takes the previous one. Anything older goes as soon as a new deploy launches, a removed deployment keeps none, and a copy nothing ever ran from goes with its failed deploy or at the next boot. Retiring one releases its hold on its build, which is what lets the build be pruned.

## Settings for one version

**Settings** on a version card opens `#/versions/<id>/settings`, one section per file, in the order base env, deploy config, engines. Three routes carry it, all behind the session gate with the other version routes.

- `GET /versions/:id/settings` answers the operator's own files read against the samples the version's current build ships. Every key comes with the comment block the sample keeps above it, the value the sample assigns, and two flags: whether the key is secret and whether the manager fills it per deployment. The answer says `no-store`.
- `PUT /versions/:id/settings` takes the revision the page loaded and commits the whole edit as one, under a single hold of the edit lock. A save made against a revision that has moved is refused with 409 `settings_changed` and the generation to reload to. A held lock is 409 `settings_locked`. One save carries at most sixteen files, and at most 512 keys in any one of them.
- `POST /versions/:id/settings/apply` publishes the build that carries the saved settings, described in the next section.

A version that has not finished a build answers 409 `settings_not_ready`, and says that its settings appear after the first build. A version that still deploys from a flat checkout answers the same code with its own reason: there is no build to make another one from.

A save must not lose a byte, because these files carry the host's own documentation in their comments and are still edited over ssh. An env file is rewritten from its own current bytes: the lines the save names get their value replaced in place, keeping the `export` prefix, the spacing up to the equals sign and any carriage return at the end. Every comment, blank line and untouched line is copied through, and a key the file does not assign is appended. The deploy config is offered as text with a **Reset to sample** action.

The page masks a secret until **Reveal**, marks a value that still equals the version's own with `default`, and says under a generated key that the manager fills it per deployment unless a value is set there. That sentence is the rule the deploy keeps: a required secret whose value the version's base or engine env already carries is neither generated nor written, so the file's own line reaches the containers. An empty one is still generated per deployment, and a value already recorded for a running deployment still wins over both, because rotating the token a running container started with is a decision rather than a side effect. Since 2026-09-26 a value the deployment stores for the key on its page's Stack settings card wins over all of them, and the recorded one stays kept for when that value is reset, see [deployment-settings.md](deployment-settings.md).

The values come back in the clear, secrets included. That is decision D13: the routes are behind the session gate, and a value the operator cannot see is one they cannot check. Which accounts should reach this page is decision D14, which is open. Today any signed-in account can, as with every other version route.

## The bundled version

The bundled version is the stack commit the manager pins. It is fetched and built on the host, through the same path an added version takes, which is decision D12 of 2026-09-09: the host checks out the version and builds it there.

A manager deploy no longer carries the stack. It writes `manager/.stack-commit` from the repository itself, `git rev-parse HEAD:manager/swarm-hls-stream`, so the pin is what the submodule records and not what a laptop has checked out. That file is the only thing about the stack a deploy ships.

The API reads that pin at boot. When the bundled row is not already on a complete build of it, boot builds that commit through the same build script, the same one-build-at-a-time mutex and the same log on the Versions page that an added version uses. **Update** on the bundled card means build that pin again. A manager that pins no commit, which is a developer machine rather than a broken deploy, keeps the row on the tree in its checkout and refuses the rebuild in plain words.

A build the mutex refuses, and a build script that could not be started at all, each write their reason into the row and move the row onto the pin, so a deploy waiting for this boot's answer can tell it from an earlier boot's. A version that still has a build stays ready with the reason beside it, and a version with nothing to deploy from is failed. A pin file that holds something that is not a commit names no commit to move the row onto, so it is logged, and it is recorded on the row only when that row has no build to fall back on.

The upgrade command on the host holds one directory under the stack versions root for its whole run. Its phases are checking, stopping, migrating, starting, verifying, and then a bounded wait for the API's own boot to reach a build of the pin. A build that failed or timed out is printed and the command exits non zero, after the guard is released, because the manager is up by then.

On a host deployed the old way, the bundled version's first build takes the stack's `.env`, `deploy/config.json` and engine envs out of the legacy tree, byte for byte, as its config root's first revision. That legacy tree is only ever read, because the engines of existing deployments still mount it, and only the bundled version reads it at all. A config root that already holds settings is left alone.

The legacy bundled checkout remains available while existing deployments reference it. A deployment created while the bundled row was legacy keeps running the legacy tree until its own next deploy moves it. Updating the manager is not an instruction to restart those deployments or discard their data.

## Contracts, targets and shared image names

The manager reads ports, slot limits, required secret names, engine defaults and supported configuration features from the selected version's contract. Unknown or unreadable allocation information causes a refusal rather than an invented port plan. Since 2026-09-26 the contract also records which setting each container reads, every `${KEY}` its block of the version's compose files names, so a changed setting can recreate the containers that read it and no others. A version built before that keeps the manager's own shorter list.

D01 limits capacity to the lower of the version's declared maximum and 100 stored deployment records. Stopped records still count. Port ownership is reserved by Docker daemon, transport and port. A stopped deployment keeps its reservations. Target verification and observed bindings determine ownership and release, rather than a script's exit code alone.

Versions that still build shared image tags require the durable admission rules in T05a. An unresolved attempt can block a conflicting deployment until the attempt is resolved. The interface names that attempt. A refusal is not a queued deployment or an automatic retry.

D09 assigned the stack image-name changes and the bundled submodule update to Levi, and both are done. As of 2026-09-25, the manager pins the stack's release `v3.4` at `dc0c55e10651367d939b2b0c2c4ff6302fc65899` and tracks upstream `main`. That release builds on `v3.1`, pinned from 2026-09-19, so it includes PR #241 and the integration work previously carried on `feat/manager-line`. The stack's older `main-v2` remains a compatibility fixture for version selection. The manager does not manufacture per-version image names through the old proposed Compose override hook. Updating that stack contract does not trigger an automatic restart.

## What is actually running

A version's current commit does not prove which code every service is using. Service observations record build and image identity. A deployment shows one commit only when its relevant services agree, otherwise it identifies the mixed service state. A partial deployment does not advance untouched services to the new build.

`last_full_deploy_commit` records a verified full deployment. It does not replace per-service evidence or establish receiving, publishing or playback readiness.

## Verification and remaining integration

Where the branch stands, 2026-09-10, at `6dc33d1`. The last full run recorded on `feat/ai-remediation` was taken at `e857994`, the head verified before the T20 completion merge: the manager unit suite 2317 cases, the whole `manager/test/database` directory 518 cases against nine disposable databases, the browser suites 166 cases against a real headless Chrome, the native transport suites 7, the shared package 321 and the frontend unit suites 100, none skipped, every typecheck clean. Those runs were on a laptop. No job of either GitHub workflow had run on a runner when this page was written.

The first real deploy happened on 2026-09-11, against the runbook in `../consensus/FIRST-DEPLOY-SESSION.md`. Migrations 013 to 031 applied in one run, the five deployments already there kept running throughout, the bundled version moved from a flat tree to immutable builds, and the version settings page ran for the first time anywhere. A second pass on 2026-09-13 ran against the manager's own public domain rather than through an ssh tunnel. Both are recorded in [../handover/main-v2-remediation.md](../handover/main-v2-remediation.md), including the defects they found.

Private execution copies landed on 2026-09-11, so a deployment no longer runs out of the immutable build directory. What is still open on top of them is T01's own slice: the atomic begin and revert of a config rollout, the creator receipt and the release of operation holds. Those repository APIs exist and nothing calls them. T06's Linux firewall checks and T05a's harness on the matching Docker Engine 29.1.3 and Compose v5.1.4 are separate acceptance items that nothing here discharges.

The task checkpoints behind this page, as they were recorded during the work. T08's approval and wizard behaviour passed unit, browser and type checks, and its eight real PostgreSQL regressions passed at `347c7dd`, including publication between read and write and a competing row lock. T18 carried those semantics into the responsive cards at `5f835ca`. T04a's guarded removal and durable markers were reviewed through `c55c9d9`. T06's no-op reference cleanup was reviewed at `b65f8d9`, and T12's direct ledger phase correction was committed at `2966ab3`. Those are the numbers of the branches as they were merged, not a rerun of the branch as it stands.

No local unit, database or browser result proves the live deployment or playback path. T22 retains that acceptance work and its separately agreed resource and spending limits, and it waits for Levi's D05 numbers.

The 2026-09-19 immutable-artifact concurrency regression was taken against `4b1726e3`. The focused shared-file run first produced five expected failures with 60 passes, covering source hashing, metadata reads, linked-copy verification and recovery capture. Commit `435c08d3` made the same three files pass all 65 cases while the byte, mode, path, symlink and inode replacement refusals stayed green. The separate cold-inventory regression first produced two expected failures with 11 passes. Commit `491b279f` made all 13 cases pass, including rejection eviction and retry. These are local focused unit results. They do not replace the Docker integration run, and the documented limit for a writer that restores size, mode and modification time is unchanged.
