# main-v2 remediation handover, 2026-09-09

Cross-provider review, OpenAI-hosted Codex, GPT-6 Astra.

## Start here

Levi requested: "okay merge everything to main-v2 locally and create handover". All 22 remediation task heads are now ancestors of local `main-v2`. Their complete histories, original branches and task worktrees are preserved. This consolidates implementation checkpoints. It does not complete the 25-row roadmap or establish deployment readiness.

The reviewed baseline was `d046ebf237f0e93dd5a41d72d6d1df9c0cd8af64`. It is where `main-v2` still points, locally and on the remote, so the baseline is preserved by the branch itself. The local backup branch `codex/main-v2-before-remediation-20260909` this line originally named is gone from this checkout, and so are the 22 task branches, but every head they pointed at is still reachable through the merge commits and every one of them is in [main-v2-merge-manifest.json](main-v2-merge-manifest.json). Thirteen explicit merge commits brought in the 22 heads because several task branches already contained dependencies.

This handover supersedes earlier local notes saying main-v2 is unchanged, local merges are forbidden, T01's service callers are still unwired, or T09 has no owned factory. The full planning debate and historical evidence remain in `.scratch/main-v2-review-consensus/`. Its `PRD.md` comments were not edited. That scratch directory remains untracked. This handover and its manifest are tracked.

No push, GitHub write, repository setting, image pull, installation, real engine build, deployment, SSH or funded-node operation was performed for this consolidation. An initial pnpm typecheck tried its automatic dependency reconciliation and stopped before removing modules. No install completed. Subsequent checks used existing local executables directly. Its small generated store is preserved under the local merge evidence directory.

## Authorization for continuation

Levi explicitly overrode the reviewer-only restriction for the agreed local work. Local worktrees, source and test edits, commits and disposable tests are authorized. He also authorized subagents and this local main-v2 consolidation. Do not ask for the same permission again.

Continue new work on a task branch from the merged main-v2, with tests first, one logical fix per commit and independent review in another worktree. PR bodies remain local drafts under `.scratch/main-v2-review-consensus/prs/`. Preserve existing source branches and other workers' resources. Do not resume an old task checkout and accidentally omit the integration fixes.

Pushes, GitHub writes, repository settings, host access, real engine builds and pulls, deployments and live money operations still require separate explicit authorization. Do not access Claude memory, estate, beeClients, secrets or the shared development services on ports 5186 and 3035.

## Roadmap, all 25 rows

The heads below are the task checkpoints included in this merge, not a claim that every acceptance criterion passed.

| Row | Included head | State and remaining acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T01a restart count | `115b194` | Correct top-level Docker restart count and regression are included. |
| T01 configuration operations | `82e2d08`, execution copies `939dd30` | Atomic claims, retained-build recovery and apply/reset/recovery service callers are connected. Immutable execution landed on 2026-09-11: a deploy runs in a private copy of its build and the build is never written into. Exact successful finalization and operation-hold release remain. |
| T02 isolated SRS validation | `1ab3e72` | Concurrent checks have private files. The real concurrent parser harness still needs CI execution. |
| T03 OME validation | `be10c3b` | XML parser, protected paths and harness are included. Recorded arm64 evidence is historical. Stack pin, amd64 and CI qualification remain. |
| T04a immutable builds | `c55c9d9` | Immutable publication, retained references, guarded removal and durable removal markers are included. A build is now immutable in fact as well as in name: since 2026-09-11 no deploy writes into one. |
| T04b bundled publication/runtime | `c61ac5e` | Durable publication command, registered candidates, receipt replay and legacy metadata CAS exist. Production CLI/upgrade adapters, private execution copies, complete observation and retirement remain. Twelve obsolete boot-publication tests remain red. |
| T05a creation guard | `3220114` | Durable admission/recovery guard and release UI are included. Matching Engine 29.1.3 and Compose v5.1.4 harness remains unrun. |
| T05b stack image changes | No task branch here | Levi owns the external stack image-name/cleanup commits and bundled submodule update under D09. |
| T06 port reservations | `b65f8d9` | Reservation and target admission are included. Combined execution verification and Linux firewall qualification remain. |
| T07 proposed deployment row | `24b85bf` | Validation, admission and write use the proposed row. Unknown critical prerequisites refuse. |
| T08 build approval | `347c7dd` | Approval names the displayed commit/build and the wizard requires an explicit valid choice. Integrated with T18 and both publication writers. |
| T09 money by transaction | `8f48fb0` | Merged. Journal, recovery, durable UI, exact target ownership, owned transport factory, bounded receipt polling, the portable intent harness and the connected SQL and browser acceptance suites are all in, with both reviews of that slice acted on. What remains is real SSH and real image qualification, which need a host and have not run. `PRODUCTION_BEE_BRIDGE_QUALIFICATIONS` was a frozen empty list when this row was written. One real qualification ran on 2026-09-14 and the record is in the file. A synthetic pass still never fills it. |
| T10 authenticated integration client | `284790c` | Confirmed-instance cleanup and atomic profile/group removal are included. Real deployment integration has not run. |
| T11 effective engine settings | `ef269a8` | Observations, draft preservation, exact-job save and captured-build validation are included. Mutable host-input execution integration remains. |
| T12 readiness and diagnostics | `2966ab3` | Readiness, diagnostics and lifecycle phase behavior are included. Complete lifecycle acceptance remains with execution integration. |
| T13 SRT default | `0a0aebc` | Per-deployment default and review copy are included. |
| T14 guided stamp purchase | No task branch | **Closed by Levi on 2026-09-11, not wanted for now.** Buying postage already works from a deployment's storage card and already quotes the cost in BZZ before the operator confirms. This row would only have added human-readable capacity and lifetime presets in place of Swarm's own amount and depth inputs, and a spending ceiling refused in the submission path rather than merely displayed. He will say if he wants it. D04 is closed with it. |
| T15 pool prerequisites | `8d326aa` | Pool creation preserves uploader drafts and handles stale membership observations. |
| T16 validation feedback | `1f14207` | Field feedback, accessible labels and focus behavior are included. |
| T17 endpoint actions | `7354bfe` | Protocol-aware link/copy actions coexist with container diagnostics. |
| T18 narrow layouts | `5f835ca` | Responsive version cards preserve exact-build approval and attempt-release controls. |
| T19 notes editing | `6b3c50c` | Separate notes updates and revision conflicts coexist with full deployment edits. |
| T20 CI checks | `ab8776c` | Merged. Three jobs run the build and unit suites, the 518 SQL tests against nine disposable databases and the 166 browser tests against a real Chrome, with no skip and no suite that never started counted as a pass. The four container-backed regressions each have a job in the manual workflow. What remains is Levi's: dispatch that manual workflow once, and turn the requirement on after the `checks` workflow has run. The T01 startup-failure file and every job of the manual workflow have never run on a runner. |
| T21 documentation | `docs/t21-reconciliation`, from `6dc33d1` | The reconciliation slice of 2026-09-10, described in its own section at the end of this file. Every page that describes behaviour was checked against the code on the branch, and every status paragraph now names the branch, the date and the commit it is true at. Update again as remaining flows close. |
| T22 controlled live acceptance | No task branch | Await D05 inputs, completed prerequisites and separate live authorization. |

## The next work

Rewritten on 2026-09-11. Everything this list used to hold has either been built, described in the dated sections below, or closed by Levi. What is left, in order:

1. ~~**The first real deploy, when Levi names a time.**~~ Done on 2026-09-11, and a second live pass on 2026-09-13, both in the dated sections at the end of this file. The runbook was `../consensus/FIRST-DEPLOY-SESSION.md`. What is left of this item is the chequebook fill, which moves a crypto asset and is therefore Levi's. Two things of T20's also wait on Levi: dispatching the docker-backed workflow so its four jobs run once, which is the only way the T01 startup-failure file ever executes, and turning the required checks on after the `checks` workflow has run.
2. **T22, the controlled live acceptance run.** It waits for Levi's D05 numbers, for the deploy above to have happened, and for a separate authorisation to spend.

Private execution copies were here and landed on 2026-09-11, described in its own section at the end of this file. What that slice leaves for T01 is its own remaining work rather than a dependency: the atomic begin and revert of a config rollout, the creator receipt, and the release of operation holds after a proven watch. Those repository APIs exist and nothing calls them, and none of them is needed for a deployment to stop writing into its build.

T14 was here and is closed, not deferred: Levi ruled on 2026-09-11 that the guided stamp purchase is not wanted for now, on the ground that the purchase already works and already quotes its cost. One thing it would have added is worth remembering if the subject returns. Postage depth is an exponent, so a digit typed wrong multiplies the spend rather than nudging it, and the form displays that cost without anything refusing it. Nothing in the repository enforces a ceiling today.

With that closed and private execution copies landed, no engineering slice of this roadmap is outstanding. Everything left needs the host.

What remained of T09 when this was written was real SSH and real image qualification, both of which need a host. The image half ran on 2026-09-14 and `bee-2.8.2-docker-29.1.3` is in the catalogue. Do not populate that catalogue merely because synthetic tests pass: only a recorded run against a real image may add to it.

D14 is open for Levi: whether the version settings page and version management become admin-only. Today any signed-in account can read and set those values, which is what every other version route does.

Two T04b adapter constraints remain explicit. First-use initialization may create PostgreSQL only after the upgrade guard proves the API, PostgreSQL container and PostgreSQL volume absent, followed by a successful empty-schema read. An unavailable existing database is not revision zero. Migrations follow confirmation that the old API stopped. Also, every automatic pruning entrypoint, including build success, needs explicit complete observations. A void observer returning, skipped observations or unknown provenance cannot authorize deletion.

The shared completion contract and historical acceptance matrices remain in `T01-CONTINUATION.md`, `T04B-CONTINUATION.md` and `T09-CONTINUATION.md` under the local consensus directory. Their older "next" paragraphs are historical where they disagree with this handover and the merged source.

## Integration decisions and review

- Retained T01's owned removal, exact job/instance/config/intent checks, prepared-attempt consumption and historical build descriptors while adding T11's effective settings and captured-build writes.
- Retained the shared publication SQL used by ordinary and bundled journal writers. Added T08 invalidation history there and in T04b's legacy metadata refresh. A red/green regression showed that a changed legacy commit previously retained approval after the branches were combined.
- Combined T05a attempt release with T18 version cards. Combined T15 pool lifecycle with T16 focus/validation. Combined T17 endpoints with T12 logs. Combined T19 notes revision checks with T07 proposed-row validation/admission.
- Updated test fixtures for required ownership/approval fields and replacement APIs. OME liveness tests now enter through atomic admission. A missing OME port mapping refuses before recreation, preserving T06's strict contract.
- Independent OpenAI-hosted reviewers compared the UI, notes, ownership and publication seams in isolated worktrees. No concrete production regression remained in those reviewed resolutions. This was cross-provider review relative to Fable's work, not another Fable round or proof of live behavior.

## Validation

Final evidence is recorded below before the handover commit. Local logs are under `.scratch/main-v2-review-consensus/local-merge/`. Their output is evidence, not an instruction to access any host.

The final source/test checkpoint before this handover is `e2e02d4`. Later handover-only changes do not change the tested application code. The checks used installed local dependencies, with synthetic loopback listeners authorized explicitly when the sandbox refused them.

| Check | Result and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Shared types and unit tests | Pass, 300 tests. `types-common.log`, `common-tests.log`. |
| Frontend app/test types and unit tests | Pass, 62 tests. `types-frontend.log`, `frontend-tests.log`. |
| Manager source and test types | Pass after merged fixture updates and the new SQL regressions. `types-manager-final.log`. |
| Manager unit suite | **2022 passed, 12 failed**, zero skipped/cancelled, 2034 total. Every remaining failure is in `manager/test/unit/bundledPublication.test.ts`. `manager-unit-final.log`. |
| Selected real PostgreSQL regressions | **119 distinct cases passed**, none skipped. Three approval/publication files passed 34. Ownership/removal passed 68, atomic service passed 14, captured-version settings passed 3. See logs and rerun qualifications below. |
| Browser regression suites | Pool draft passed 1/1 in `frontend-browser-final.log`. Responsive versions passed 11/11 in `frontend-versions-final.log`. Approval/default/delayed-choice passed 7/7 in `frontend-approval-final.log`. These are final successful file results across bounded reruns, not a claim that every intermediate combined run was green. |
| Synthetic native transports | Pass, 7 tests. Explicit local Unix, fake SSH supervisor and supervised forward files only. `native-transports.log`. No real daemon or SSH host was contacted. |
| Compilation | Shared TypeScript, manager TypeScript and frontend TypeScript/Vite compile passed. `build-common.log`, `build-manager.log`, `build-frontend.log`. Frontend emitted its existing large-chunk warning, about 832 kB before gzip. This was application compilation, not an engine/image build or deployment. |
| Git | All 22 frozen task heads included, source refs unchanged, no unmerged paths. Final handover commit is on main-v2. Backup baseline preserved. |

The SQL reviewer used the exact merged production code plus fixture correction `3436c20` in an isolated checkout. The new two-test commit was then cherry-picked as `80604d2`. `approval-publication-sql.log` passed 34/34. `ownership-removal-sql.log` passed 68 cases, but two other files failed import because that review checkout lacked already-pinned saxes. After copying existing local packages, `service-settings-sql-rerun.log` passed 14 cases and one other file stopped for missing synthetic DATABASE_URL. `settings-capture-sql-rerun.log` then passed its unchanged 3 cases. Preserve those setup failures and successful reruns. No database assertion failure remains in the selected set.

The original sandboxed manager run failed because local test listeners were refused. Its log is retained as `manager-unit-initial.log` and is not product evidence. The first authorized aggregate run then exposed four OME fixture failures in addition to the 12 known bundled tests. Those four are fixed and pass. The browser logs retain the missing mock attempts endpoint, explicit late-version selection and render-timing failures preceding their corrections.

The T03 draft already records all four provenance checks for the introduced `saxes` 6.0.0 and `xmlchars` 2.2.0 versions. It records 2021-11-07 and 2019-09-06 publish dates, verified registry signatures, installed-tree signature verification and no listed advisories including malware. Neither package has a provenance attestation. This is carried historical evidence from [../consensus/prs/t03-ome-xml.md](../consensus/prs/t03-ome-xml.md), not a fresh registry query during this merge. No dependency version was changed by the conflict resolutions.

No full real deployment suite, Linux firewall qualification, actual SRS/OME/shared-image container harness, production SSH/image qualification, funded transfer, upload, playback or T22 run occurred. CI is still a partial draft. The merged branch is therefore **not release-ready**.

## Open inputs and funded assets

D01 through D10 are already decided. D04 still needs the guided stamp preset capacities/lifetimes and spending ceiling. D05 still needs the live spend cap, duration, publishing content and disposition of the node's funds. These are inputs to decided policies, not a reopened design vote.

The funded `review-20260907` deployment was not touched. The historical 0.5 BZZ chequebook fill's submission remains unverified. There is no transaction evidence here establishing that it was unsent, settled or safe to retry. Preserve the node and its assets. Do not run the R04/shared-image script on the host. The matching-version T05a harness is a later isolated run on Engine 29.1.3 and Compose v5.1.4.

## Preserved local state

- Original task worktrees and all 22 frozen source refs remain. The merge manifest records exact heads. Historical/rebased feature branches outside the remediation set were not indiscriminately merged or deleted.
- Synthetic PostgreSQL fixture `285c10f9f8ae41c877fb54fe88f53e2ec3b8bb9ae3808872c02cee74bbadbe9a`, loopback 62527, belongs to `implement_t08_completion`. It holds synthetic task databases and previously retained interrupted schemas.
- Synthetic fixture `6b755f793656af867ad33f9564fabc1a5d06f2d324a88cad91fe58f748fd656b`, loopback 61175, belongs to `implement_t12_readiness`. Preserve the previously documented incomplete-run schema. Only the owners clean these fixtures.
- Three review trees outside the repository, one for the integration SQL, one for the documentation and one read-only UI review. These are separate from the original task trees.

On resume, read this file first, inspect main-v2's actual HEAD and working tree, then choose one remaining complete flow. Verify any retained resource by its exact recorded identity before use. Never infer cleanup authority from a name prefix or a stopped test runner.

## Where the record lives, 2026-09-09

The planning and acceptance files under `.scratch/main-v2-review-consensus/` are now also tracked, unchanged, under `docs/consensus/`, with an index in its README. The scratch directory stays as the home of the originals, the logs and the browser evidence.

## After the merge: the publication command slice, 2026-09-09

Fable (Anthropic), with Opus agents implementing and reviewing. Levi decided to keep the durable publication design and build the command, opened PR #40 from `feat/ai-remediation` into `main-v2`, and authorised pushing every finished slice to that branch.

What landed: `bundled:seal` on the laptop, `manager:upgrade` from the new image on the host, the deploy script wired to both, the twelve red boot-publication tests replaced by tests through the new path, and a sweep that removes every shipped package and claimed copy a finished publication made unreadable, so the host does not keep a copy of every secret every deploy shipped. Two reviews of the slice and one targeted review of the fixes found and closed, among others, the first-use probe counting the upgrade's own one-off container, `docker compose run` swallowing the rest of the remote script, the first-use rule firing again after the migration, the started api never being checked against the image the upgrade built, and the repository's `.dockerignore` letting `manager/.env` into the image build context. The briefs are `../consensus/T04B-COMMAND-BRIEF.md` and `../consensus/T04B-COMMAND-FIXES.md`.

Verified at the merge: manager 2146 unit tests green, common 300, frontend 62, the three typechecks clean, the database test directory 159 green against a disposable local Postgres, and the manager image build context clean of the env file. Nothing has run against the real host. The first deploy with this flow needs Levi's word.

Still open from the list above, in this order: exact execution and recovery completion (T01 with T04b private execution copies, so deploys stop writing into the immutable build), T09 receipt polling and its harness, T20 and T21, then T14 and T22 on Levi's numbers. The D09 stack commits reached the stack's main-v3 the same evening, see the next section.

## The bundled stack is main-v3, 2026-09-09

Levi ruled that the stack's `main-v3` is the stable default and that `main-v2` is obsolete, kept only as a second version to test version selection with. He fast-forwarded the stack's `main-v3` to the four D09 commits (head `9f1255b`, the two built services no longer name their images, a whole-project clean removes the images it built), so no branch of the stack repository is referenced anywhere: the bundled submodule pins the tip of `main-v3`.

What landed on `feat/ai-remediation`: the pin moves from the tip of the stack's `main-v2` (`ee99c36`) to `9f1255b`, the submodule's tracked branch becomes `main-v3`, and the manager README, the deploy README and the engine-control feature page say which version is bundled and what its contract decides (slot ceiling 99, `API_AUTH_TOKEN` and `SRS_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` generated per deployment, the SRS API port published, engines on a config file of their own, chequebook floor 0.5 BZZ). No code changed: the manager reads all of that from the stack's contract.

Verified with the new pin: manager 2146 unit tests green and typecheck clean, the real tree's contract read with no warning and `sharedImageTags` false, the stack installed and built on the laptop with the same two commands `deploy/deploy.sh` runs. A trial seal of the real tree then refused the laptop's stack `.env`, which still follows the `main-v2` sample and lacks twenty keys the `main-v3` sample declares (only the key names were seen). That is the check working as designed, and it means the first deploy after this bump needs those keys added to `manager/swarm-hls-stream/.env` first. The deploy README now says so. The trial's generation-one revision file was removed again, so the laptop checkout is back to never having had one and the deploy's `--adopt-inputs` takes the files as they are.

Nothing has run against the real host. Next, unchanged: exact execution and recovery completion, then T09, T20, T21, T14 and T22.

## The bundled stack is built on the host, 2026-09-09

Levi's D12: "We run the infra manager on the server. The host should be able to
checkout and pull the version or tag or branch whatever and build it there.
Immediately it shows the settings that's needed for that version but filled with
the working defaults." The bundled version stops arriving with the deploy. The
brief is `../consensus/BUNDLED-ON-HOST-BRIEF.md`, the work is on
`feat/bundled-on-host` off `feat/ai-remediation`.

**What changed.** `deploy/deploy.sh` writes `manager/.stack-commit` from the
repository itself, `git rev-parse HEAD:manager/swarm-hls-stream`, so the pin is
what the submodule records and not what a laptop has checked out. That file is
now the only thing about the stack a deploy carries. At boot the api reads the
pin and, when the bundled row is not already on a complete build of it, builds
that commit through the same path an added version takes: the same build script,
the same one-build-at-a-time mutex, the same log on the Versions page. Update on
the bundled version means rebuild that pin, and refuses with a plain message on a
machine that pins none. The build script learned to fetch a forty character
commit, which `git clone --branch` refuses. The upgrade command lost the
shipment: its phases are checking, stopping, migrating, starting, verifying and
then a bounded wait, `--bundled-timeout`, for the api's own boot to reach a build
of the pin. A build that failed or timed out is printed and exits non zero, after
the guard is released, because the manager is up by then.

**Settings.** The first build on a host deployed the old way takes the bundled
stack's `.env`, `deploy/config.json` and engine envs out of the legacy tree at
`SHLS_ROOT`, byte for byte, as the config root's first revision. The legacy tree
is only ever read, because running engines still mount it, and only the bundled
version reads it at all. Then every env file is completed from the sample of the
version being built: the sample's own line for each key the file lacks, in the
sample's order, appended and committed as one more revision, which the build then
captures. A file that does not parse, and a base env that is still short after
completion, are refused with today's messages. That is the settings model the
version settings page of D13 will read: one set per version on the host,
committed as revisions in `.config-revision.json` under the same lock the editing
script takes.

**What went.** `bundled:seal`, the package format, the shipment journal
(migration 030 drops `bundled_shipments` and its trigger, keeping
`publication_revision` and its trigger), the publication command, the
materializer, the package claim and sweep, the toolchain flag, and the strict
path mode of the host config capture that only the seal used. Their tests went
with them. The deploy script lost the stack build, the seal, the package rsync,
the identity checks and the remote home probe those guarded, because with the
package gone the only values it still interpolates into a remote command line are
a local `git rev-parse` and a local `shasum`.

**The T04b guarantee still holds and is still tested.** A deployment created
while the bundled row was legacy keeps running the legacy tree until its own next
deploy moves it: `manager/test/unit/deployBuildDescriptor.test.ts`, "runs the
legacy tree until the bundled version is published, and its build after, each by
its own deploy". `bundledBootRecovery.test.ts` still asserts that boot's metadata
refresh adopts nothing and writes nothing into the legacy tree, and
`bundledPublication.test.ts` was reworked around the new boot behaviour rather
than deleted.

**Verified.** Manager unit 2063 of 2063, manager database 98 of 98 against a
disposable local Postgres, common 300, frontend 68, both manager typechecks and
the common and frontend typechecks clean, `bash -n deploy/deploy.sh` clean.
Earlier runs of the same suites, at load average 34 to 45 on this machine, failed
a handful of timing-sensitive tests that pass alone, including
`ownedChequebookPreparation.test.ts` and the pre-existing
`legacyMetadataRefresh.test.ts` and `acquireDockerBeeStream.test.ts`, which
nothing in this slice touches. `feat/ai-remediation` failed four of the same
tests under that load, so the sensitivity is the machine's and not this branch's.
Nothing ran against the real host, nothing was pushed, and no `.env` of the
submodule was read.

**Two things the brief asked for that are not here.** The build script's commit
path is covered by a real run against a repository on this disk, put behind the
stack's own https url with git's `insteadOf` in a home directory of the test's
making, so neither the url check nor anything else in the script was relaxed for
it. `readManagerPublication.ts` was kept and simplified rather than deleted: the
brief lists it among the removed modules but also says `readPublication` keeps
the first-use rule and the schema state, and something has to read the schema.
Its database test was rewritten rather than removed, and it is where the
migration-030 assertions live.

**After the reviews, 2026-09-10.** A security review and a correctness review
ran in parallel over the slice and found fourteen things, all now fixed on
`feat/bundled-on-host`, one test-first commit pair each. The two that mattered
were the same leftover from both sides: `removeGuarded` still asked
`bundled_shipments` whether a version was held, and migration 030 drops that
table, so the first version removal after an upgrade would have failed on the
host and eleven database tests failed on the branch. The other one that could
have reached the host is the guard: the twenty minute bundled wait did not catch
its own read errors, so one failed query after the api was verified left
`.manager-upgrade` behind and refused every later deploy. It now releases before
it rethrows.

Three findings were about the settings files, which hold the stream passphrase,
the api token, the webhook token and the bee passphrase. They were being written
at 0644 under a versions root anyone on the host can enter, because the atomic
replacement wrote its temporary file with no mode. A file a commit creates is now
owner only and a file it replaces keeps the mode an operator gave it. The
completion and the legacy carry over both read a file and then took the lock only
for the write, so an edit made in between was overwritten: `withHostConfigLock`
now takes the lock once and hands the body a commit. And the set of settings
files was built with calls that follow symbolic links, so a link planted in the
legacy tree would have had its target read in the api container and committed as
generation one. Every path of the set is now lstat checked, the `deploy` and
`engines` directories included, and what was passed by is logged.

The build script fetched from whatever `remote.origin.url` the clone on disk
carried, so the https only check held for the first build alone. It repoints
origin at the checked url before every fetch. The deploy refuses a
`BUNDLED_TIMEOUT` that is not whole seconds and an ssh target starting with a
dash, keeps the exit status of the upgrade so the receipt reaches the deployer
before the failure, and `--bundled-timeout` is now optional with the twenty
minute default the operations already carried. `deploysBuildOf` moved next to
`deployRootProblem` so boot and the upgrade decide ready by the same rule, and
the wait counts a `lastError` as its own only when the row has moved since it
started the api, which is what tells this build's failure from one an earlier
boot left standing. That baseline is read in `startProject`, which is the last
moment before the new api can run its own boot.

Two gaps in the tests were closed by mutation rather than by a code change.
"Existing lines byte for byte untouched" had no fixture with a comment, a blank
line, trailing spaces or a CRLF line, so stripping every comment and trimming the
leading blank both passed. Both now go red. The bundled card's enabled Update
button was asserted nowhere, and putting the old disable back passed every test.
`frontend/test/versions-layout.test.mjs`, which renders the real page in headless
Chrome, now asserts the button is enabled and the commit is on the card. That
file is not part of `pnpm test`, which reads `src/**/*.test.ts` only, so it was
run on its own: 12 of 12. The live build script test also set only `HOME`, which
`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` and `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` outrank, so a developer with either
set would have sent that fetch to github.com. It answers all of them now.

**Verified, 2026-09-10.** Manager unit 2081 of 2081. The whole
`manager/test/database` directory 492 of 492 with nothing skipped, against a
disposable Postgres holding the nine databases the files name, every
`*_TEST_PG_PORT` set. That is five fewer than the base commit, which is exactly
the four shipment cases and the one dropped table this round removed. Common 300,
frontend 68, both manager typechecks and the common and frontend typechecks
clean, `bash -n deploy/deploy.sh` clean, and the remote heredoc body parses as
bash on its own. Nothing ran against the real host, nothing was pushed, and no
`.env` of the submodule was read.

**Third round, 2026-09-10.** A targeted re-review of those fixes found six more,
all now in, one test-first commit each. Two were the same two shapes again, in
places the first round missed. `manager/scripts/stack-config-edit.sh`, the
supported way to edit a version's settings by hand, created its temporary file
at whatever the umask allowed, so one `set` widened a 0600 `.env` back to 0644
and undid the mode fix through the one door an operator is told to use. It now
creates that file owner only and gives it the mode the target already has, and
the revision manifest goes the same way. `seedHostConfig` asked whether a file
was there outside the lock and committed under a fresh one, so a file an
operator created while a build ran was written over by the sample. It holds the
lock across both now, and `adoptHostConfig` commits through the caller's hold
rather than taking its own.

A legacy tree whose `deploy` or `engines` is a symbolic link was reported as
holding nothing at all, so nothing was carried and no log said why. Those two
paths are now named the same way a linked file is. The modes were asserted only
where a file already existed, so the rule that a carried file lands owner only
and a completed file keeps the mode it had was not held by anything. It is now,
proven by a mutation that drops the mode handling and turns three suites red.

The last one is the twenty minute wait a deploy does for the bundled build. It
told this boot's answer from an earlier one's by the row having changed, and a
boot that never started the build left the row byte identical, so the deploy sat
out its whole bound and then printed an error from an earlier boot. Every path
in `ensureBundledBuild` that does not start the build now writes the reason into
the row and moves it onto the pin: the mutex refusing while another version
builds, a `.stack-commit` that holds something that is not a commit, and a build
whose script could not be started at all. A version that still has a build stays
ready with the reason beside it, a version with nothing to deploy from is
failed, and a machine with no pin file, which is a laptop rather than a broken
deploy, is still left alone. `docs/features/stack-versions.md` lost the last
mention of shipment records among the removal holds.

**Verified, 2026-09-10.** Manager unit 2096 of 2096, fifteen more than the round
before and nothing else moved. The whole `manager/test/database` directory 492 of
492 with nothing skipped, run the nine-database way. Common 300, frontend 68,
both manager typechecks, the frontend typecheck and `bash -n deploy/deploy.sh`
clean. Nothing ran against the real host, nothing was pushed, and no `.env` of
the submodule was read.

Merged into `feat/ai-remediation` as 1a9cfd2 on 2026-09-10, with the brief for the next slice, the version settings page, committed beside it (`../consensus/VERSION-SETTINGS-BRIEF.md`). CI is green on the pushed head. Recorded for T20: `frontend/test/versions-layout.test.mjs`, which holds the bundled card's test, runs in neither `pnpm test` nor the checks workflow yet.


## The version settings page, 2026-09-10

Every stack version keeps three kinds of file the operator owns, beside its
checkout on the host: the base `.env`, `deploy/config.json` and one `.env` per
engine. Until now the only way to change one was `stack-config-edit.sh` over
ssh. There is a page for them now, one per version, reached from a **Settings**
button on the version card, and it is what D12 and D13 asked for: a working env
setup, shown and editable, with the secret-like values revealable and settable
by hand.

Three routes carry it, all behind the session gate with the other version
routes. `GET /versions/:id/settings` answers the operator's own files read
against the samples the version's current build ships, so every key comes with
the comment block that sample keeps above it, the value the sample assigns, and
two flags: whether it is secret and whether the manager fills it per deployment.
`PUT` takes the revision the page loaded and commits the whole edit as one, and
`POST /versions/:id/settings/apply` publishes the build that carries it. A
version that has never finished a build answers 409 `settings_not_ready`, and
says that its settings appear after the first build.

What the save must not do is lose a byte. These files carry the host's own
documentation in their comments and are still read and edited over ssh, so an
env file is rewritten from its own current bytes: the lines the save names get
their value replaced in place, keeping the `export` prefix and the spacing up to
the equals sign and any carriage return at the end, and every comment, blank
line and untouched line is copied through. A key the file does not assign is
appended. The whole save runs under one hold of the edit lock, generation check
included, so a page and an ssh session cannot write over each other, and a save
made against a revision that has moved is refused with 409 `settings_changed`
carrying the generation to reload to.

Apply is the part that makes a saved setting reach anything. A deployment reads
its settings from the build it runs, and fetching and running `pnpm -r build`
again for one changed line takes minutes. So apply publishes another build of
the same commit instead: the current build's tree with the settings files
replaced by the committed revision, a fresh build id from `freeBuildId`, the old
manifest's commit and toolchain kept, the revision's generation and hashes
recorded, and a new `treeSharing` field saying whether the unchanged files were
hard linked or copied. Builds stay immutable, so nothing is ever written into an
existing build directory. The unchanged files are hard links, because a
published build is never written to again and the tree is a `node_modules` and a
set of bundles that differ in nothing. A link falls back to a copy on EXDEV,
EPERM or EMLINK, and a symbolic link in the tree is recreated as one rather than
followed. Apply holds the build mutex for its whole run and refuses with the
existing 409 `stack_build_busy` while a build is going, rather than inventing a
second code for the same condition.

The generated secrets rule closes the gap the page would otherwise open. A page
that shows `API_AUTH_TOKEN` and then lets the manager generate a different value
per deployment is a page that lies. Now a required secret whose value the
version's own base or engine env already carries is neither generated nor
written, so the file's own line reaches the containers, which is exactly how
`SRT_PASSPHRASE` and `STREAM_KEY` have always behaved when a deployment set
neither. An empty one is still generated per deployment, and a value already in
`profiles.stack_secrets` still wins over both, because rotating the token a
running container was started with is a decision rather than a side effect. The
rule is one function, `versionSuppliedSecrets`, read by `stackSecretsFor` in the
orchestrator from the same build root `writeProfileEnv` copies the base env
from.

The page masks a secret until **Reveal**, marks a value that still equals the
version's own with `default`, says under a generated key that the manager fills
it per deployment unless a value is set there, and offers the deploy config as a
text area with a **Reset to sample** action. **Save**, **Save and apply** and
**Discard** sit in the footer, a save carries only the keys that moved, and the
two refusals arrive as what to do rather than as a code. The values do come back
in the clear, which is D13: the routes are behind the session gate, a value the
operator cannot see is one they cannot check, and nothing on either side logs
one. The manager logs key names only.

Two mutations were run against the new tests before the code was committed.
Stripping comment lines in the env rewrite turns four cases of
`envSettingsText.test.ts` red. Hard linking the settings files with the rest of
the tree, which would write the new build's values through into the build every
deployment is currently running, turns two cases of `versionSettingsApply.test.ts`
red. The links themselves are checked by inode, both ways: the shared files are
one inode and the settings files, the manifest and the marker are not.

`frontend/test/versions-layout.test.mjs` moved with the card: it counted four
controls per row and there are five now, so it asserts five and the same
everything-fits property at 723, 390 and 1280 pixels. The new browser test is
`frontend/test/version-settings-browser.test.mjs`, which renders the real page
against an offline fixture at 390 pixels.

**Verified, 2026-09-10.** Manager unit 2158 of 2158, sixty two more than the
round before and nothing else moved. The whole `manager/test/database` directory
496 of 496 with nothing skipped, run the nine-database way, four more than
before. Common 307, frontend 78, both manager typechecks and the common and
frontend typechecks clean. The two browser suites were run on their own, as
neither is in `pnpm test`: `versions-layout` 12 of 12 and `version-settings` 13
of 13. Nothing ran against the real host, nothing was pushed, and no `.env` of
the submodule was read.

**The two reviews, 2026-09-10.** Two reviewers went over the slice at `637d758`
with probes and mutations, and a third pass looked at it against the design. The
correctness review found five high and eight medium problems, the security
review two high, five medium and eight low, and the design pass one high gap and
one page nit. Four of those low security findings became fixes of their own, two
were folded into the items beside them, and two were looked at and left alone,
as were five low correctness findings. One question goes to Levi rather than
into code: any signed-in account can read and set these values, which is what
every other route does today, and whether version settings become admin-only is
his to decide. Everything else in `docs/consensus/VERSION-SETTINGS-FIXES.md` is
in.

The gap against D12 was that a version added in the UI never got
`engines/<engine>/.env` at all, so its page had no engine section and half the
secrets the stack keeps could not be set at version level. Seeding now walks the
same sample pairs the completion walks, which means every engine the build tree
ships. The stack's own `ensure_engine_env` copies that same sample when the file
is missing, so a deploy reads what it always did.

What the reviewers actually measured, in the order it was fixed. Every build's
copy of a settings file was world readable, 644 in a 755 directory, and the
apply path carried that 644 forward, as did the deployment's own
`.env.<profile>` holding the generated secrets. All three are 0600 now, and an
existing deployment env is narrowed on the next deploy. Nothing told the
operator that a saved change had reached no build, so the answer carries the
current build's own input generation and the page says `applied` or names the
revision the build is still on. Apply with nothing changed published another
identical build every time, each one clearing the version's approval and walking
the protected build window, so it now answers the build that already carries the
revision with `reused` and publishes nothing. An apply refused with
`stack_build_busy` skipped the page's reload, so the operator's next Save was
refused as somebody else's change when it was their own.

A value the stack's env loader and the manager read differently was written
through: `abc #notacomment` became `abc`, padding was kept by one reader and
dropped by the other, and a quote that did not close swallowed the rest. One
rule in `common` now refuses those, plus the C0 controls and the two Unicode
line separators, and the page shows the same refusal under the field before the
save goes out. `SRS_CONF_FILE` and `OME_CONF_FILE` take only an absolute path,
because the version's compose override mounts whatever they hold, and the regex
that already guarded the per-deployment value moved to `common` so both sides
use one. The refusals name the key and never the value, type errors included.

The rest. A required secret the base env declares blank is the base env's
answer, because the root file wins in the deploy script, and the engine env
decides only a key the base env does not name at all. Apply hard linked the
previous build's `.env.<profile>`, which `writeProfileEnv` truncates in place,
so a deploy on the new build wrote into the build every running deployment
reads. A held edit lock came back as a 500 with the recovery buried in the log
and is now 409 `settings_locked` with the manager's own words and a Try again.
A path of the set holding a link or a directory fell out of the answer silently
and is now named. The GET says `no-store`. One save carries at most sixteen
files and 512 keys, names each file once, and a body over the limit is a 413.
A description took the paragraph documenting a commented out neighbour, so
`ORPHAN_REAP_MS` was explaining `HLS_FRAGMENT`, and a section rule opened two
others. `settings_not_ready` has three reasons instead of one and no null in
any of them, a legacy row offers no settings page at all, a key the version does
not declare can be removed from the page, and a masked field asks the browser
not to save it.

Five mutations were run and reverted. Reading the revision before the lock in
`saveHostConfigSettings` turns the new deterministic interleave in
`versionSettingsSave.test.ts` red and leaves the other four green, which is the
property that file is named for and did not have. Printing `key=value` in
`describeSettingsSave` turns two of its three cases red. Taking the `finally`
out of `applySettings` turns the mutex case red. Unanchoring `SETTINGS_PATH_RE`
and dropping the 64 hex guard in `writeProfileEnv` turn four cases red. Dropping
the `typeError` messages turns the echo case red.

**Verified, 2026-09-10, after the fixes.** Manager unit 2205 of 2205, forty
seven more than the round before. The whole `manager/test/database` directory
497 of 497 with nothing skipped, run the nine-database way, one more than
before. Common 318, frontend 83, both manager typechecks and the common and
frontend typechecks clean. The two browser suites on their own: `versions-layout`
12 of 12 and `version-settings` 23 of 23, ten more than before. Nothing ran
against the real host, nothing was pushed, and no `.env` of the submodule was
read.

**The targeted re-review, 2026-09-10.** A third reviewer went back over the
fixes, confirmed every one of them and had thirty one of thirty three mutations
go red. Six small things came out of it, section R of
`docs/consensus/VERSION-SETTINGS-FIXES.md`, and two of them mattered. A key's
description ended at any comment that looked like an assignment, and a wrapped
sentence looks like one: the block above `BEE_PUBLISHERS` in the stack's own
sample ends on a line reading `# ABR_ENABLED=true, since with no ladder there is
nothing to map onto.`, so the key lost the five lines that say what it is. A
comment ends the run now only when it is a key, an equals sign and a value with
no whitespace, and the fixture carries that real block rather than a shortened
cut of it. The sixteen file bound on a save was pinned by a test sending
seventeen paths no version keeps, so the service refused them as absent and the
bound was never what answered. Both mutations were made, seen red and reverted.
The rest are smaller. Save and Save and apply go off while a field holds a value
the shared rule refuses and the footer names those keys, so a refused value
costs no round trip. The page takes its revision from the reload rather than
from the save the reload was overwriting. Two README sentences wrap where their
neighbours do, a doubled blank line is gone, and the paragraph above now says
eight low security findings rather than four.

**Verified, 2026-09-10, after the third round.** Manager unit 2207 of 2207, two
more than the round before. Common 318, unchanged, and frontend 88, five more.
Both manager typechecks and the common and frontend typechecks clean. The two
browser suites on their own: `versions-layout` 12 of 12 and `version-settings`
24 of 24, one more than before. The database directory was not touched by this
round and was not run. Nothing ran against the real host, nothing was pushed,
and the only `.env` of the submodule read was the `.env.sample` the fixture's
block was copied from.

Merged into `feat/ai-remediation` as 7d9af23 on 2026-09-10, after three rounds: the implementation, the two reviews with their fixes, and the targeted re-review with its fixes. Verified by Fable at 8bf512d before the merge: manager unit 2207 of 2207, the whole database directory 497 of 497 the nine-database way, common 318, frontend 88, the browser suites 12 and 24 on their own, every typecheck clean, the deploy script parses, no em-dash or semicolon in any doc, commit message or added comment, and the submodule pointer unchanged. One accident on the task branch, a scratch directory picked up by a `git add -A`, was replayed out of the history before the merge, and `.scratch/` is ignored from now on. The runbook for the first real deploy and the signed-in live test is `../consensus/FIRST-DEPLOY-SESSION.md`. D14, whether version settings become admin-only, is open for Levi.

## Receipt polling, a portable harness and connected acceptance, 2026-09-10

Until now a transfer that Bee answered with a transaction hash sat in
`submitted` until somebody opened the transfer page and pressed Check. Nobody
watching meant nobody knowing, and the node stayed locked behind that unread
operation. The manager checks for itself now.

An operation that enters `submitted` is given one budget of 30 minutes, written
on the row as `receipt_poll_until` by migration 031 and carried to the browser
as `receiptPollUntil`. While the budget lasts the manager asks the chain for the
receipt about every 20 seconds through the receipt check that already existed,
one batch at a time, scheduling the next tick after a batch ends rather than
from its start so batches cannot overlap. A settled or reverted receipt ends the
polling by changing the state. The budget is never renewed: no operator action
extends it, a restart resumes only the operations whose budget has not passed,
and every operation recorded before this slice keeps an empty deadline and is
never polled. An operation in `submitting` or `unknown` is never polled at all,
so recovery stays the operator's explicit action, and neither is one carrying a
hash conflict.

The two surfaces that show a waiting transfer follow along. The transfer detail
page and the Move BZZ dialog re-read the saved record every 10 seconds while the
deadline is ahead, and stop when the state changes, when the deadline passes or
when the operator leaves. Both only read the saved record. Neither asks the
chain, because the manager is doing that. While polling runs they say so and
name the deadline in the operator's own local time, and once it passes they say
that automatic checks ended without a final receipt and that Check asks the
chain again. The three numbers live once, in `common`, so the manager and the
page cannot drift apart.

Two harness problems are closed with it. The intent browser suite no longer
assumes a Vite listener on port 54291 that nobody starts: every case now owns
its own API and its own Vite on free ports, like every other browser suite. And
the composition is finally exercised whole. `chequebookConnected.test.ts` signs
in over HTTP, goes through the real router behind the real session and same-site
gates into a real PostgreSQL journal, out over the owned Docker transport to a
synthetic Bee, and reads the outcome back. `transfer-connected-browser.test.mjs`
does the same with the browser as the only client, against that manager run as a
forked process. Only the Bee, the chain and the database are synthetic. Both
suites need `T09_TEST_PG_PORT` and skip out loud without it.

**Verified, 2026-09-10.** Manager unit 2218 of 2218, eleven more than before.
Common 321, three more. Frontend unit 95, seven more. The three chequebook
database files with a disposable PostgreSQL on port 55436: connected 8 of 8,
operations 50 of 50, seven more than before, targets 31 of 31, none skipped. The
browser suites one file at a time: intent 3, dialog 10, history 9, recovery 10,
api 2, recovery-api 2, the new polling suite 3 and the new connected suite 3,
all passing, and the connected suite verified to skip with its reason printed
when the database variable is unset. Every workspace typecheck clean,
`git diff --check` clean against the branch base, and no em-dash or semicolon in
any added prose, comment, UI string or commit message. Nothing ran against the
real host, nothing was pushed, and no credential was read.

What remains of T09 after this slice is unchanged and separate: actual SSH and
real image qualification. `PRODUCTION_BEE_BRIDGE_QUALIFICATIONS` is still empty
and a synthetic pass qualifies nothing. T14 still waits on Levi's D04 numbers.

## What the two reviews of the receipt polling slice changed, 2026-09-10

Two reviews read the slice above on detached worktrees at its head, one for
correctness and one for security, with a disposable PostgreSQL and twenty five
mutations between them. Nothing they found was a wrong state machine or a leak.
Two were wrong information on a money screen, several were places where the code
was right and no test would have noticed it stopping being right, and one was a
runaway in the fixtures. All of them are fixed on the same branch.

The dialog no longer flashes. It re-reads the saved record every ten seconds
unattended, and it used to clear the record at the start of each of those reads,
so for the length of a round trip the evidence panel was replaced by the sentence
saying the transaction outcome is unknown. That sentence was untrue at that
moment and it appeared every ten seconds. A re-read of the same request now keeps
what is on screen until the manager answers, and only an answer that really says
the record is missing or incomplete clears it.

A failed read no longer ends the automatic re-reads. One synthetic 503 used to
be enough: the page scheduled nothing from its failure branch and never read
again. A fifteen second timeout, a tunnel blip or a manager restart during a
deploy would have done it. A failed read now costs one cycle.

A conflicted transfer is no longer shown as polled. The manager excludes a row
whose failure reason is `hash_conflict` from its own checks, but the page decided
from the state and the deadline alone, so it promised checks that never happen
and, after the deadline, told the operator to press a Check button that a
conflicted transfer does not offer.

A poll that sees nothing new no longer moves the revision. The manager checks
about every twenty seconds and almost every check sees the same pending answer,
and each one wrote a new revision, about ninety over one budget. The operator's
Check refuses when the revision moved under it, and the recovery actions remount
on it, so a good share of Check presses during polling came back saying the saved
transfer had changed. A check that changes what it observed still advances the
revision. One that does not now records only when it happened.

The poller's log reached nobody. `index.ts` passes no polling options, so the log
was the no-op default and a journal that stopped answering was never recorded
anywhere. It goes through the manager's own `Logger` now, a warning for the
journal and information for the per-tick notes, and the factory hands the poller
two bound calls rather than the whole repository and the whole receipt check.

A shutdown no longer waits out a whole batch. The loop over the due rows never
looked at whether it had been stopped, and twenty rows at the receipt inspector's
fifteen second timeout during an RPC outage is about five minutes, past the
ninety seconds systemd allows before killing the process with its transport
cleanup unverified. The page also says now that the gap between checks grows
while the chain endpoint does not answer, and the feature doc records the worst
case.

Three things were right and untested, and now have tests: that a repeated
response cannot renew a polling budget, that a spent budget stops the dialog's
re-reads as well as the page's, and that the fixture's Vite port comes from its
own probe rather than from the environment. The connected fixtures now refuse to
run unless the API is on loopback and the synthetic Docker is on its own private
socket, they unwind a start that fails partway, and their close runs every step
before reporting the first failure.

The browser fixtures stopped filling the machine. Every fixture built its own
9 MB Vite cache inside a temporary directory that nothing ever removed. Measured
here before the fix: 575 such directories holding 5.0 GB. They share one cache
under the frontend `node_modules` now, which also skips the cold start, and a
fixture with nothing to report removes its own directory. The 477 old directories
whose contents were only that cache and an empty log were removed after checking
each one, freeing 4.0 GB. The 113 that also hold screenshots from earlier runs
were left alone, 958 MB, for Levi to decide on.

**Verified, 2026-09-10, after the fix round.** Manager unit 2222 of 2222, four
more than before. Common 321, unchanged. Frontend unit 98, three more. The three
chequebook database files with a disposable PostgreSQL on port 55436: connected
10 of 10, two more, operations 54 of 54, four more, targets 31 of 31, none
skipped. The browser suites one file at a time: intent 3, dialog 10, api 2,
recovery-api 2, history 9, recovery 10, polling 8, five more, the new fixture
file 3, and connected 3, which was also run without the database variable and
skipped all three out loud. Every workspace typecheck clean after building
common, `git diff --check` clean against the branch base, and no em-dash or
semicolon in any added prose, comment, UI string or commit message. Nothing ran
against the real host, nothing was pushed, and no credential was read.

**Merged, 2026-09-10.** Merged into `feat/ai-remediation` as 8f48fb0 after the
S8 ceiling was anchored to the record instead of the clock (b5a85e8) and a
mini-round of five test-quality items from the targeted re-review (0decec0).
Verified by Fable at 0decec0 on a quiet machine: manager unit 2223 of 2223, the
whole database directory 518 of 518 the nine-database way with no skips, common
321, frontend unit 100, every browser suite green one file at a time, with the
note that `mock-engine-observations.test.mjs` runs only under `node --import
tsx --conditions=development` from the frontend package (T20 records the
command), every typecheck clean, prose clean, no submodule or lockfile movement.
Housekeeping on this laptop: 477 leftover `t09-http-*` fixture directories that
held only a Vite cache were removed (4.0 GB), 113 that also hold screenshots
were kept. Still open after this slice: the production Bee bridge qualification
catalog is empty, real SSH and real image qualification have not run, and T14
waits on the D04 numbers.

## Checks that run what the repository claims, T20, 2026-09-10

Before this slice the workflow ran the build, the three unit suites and the
frontend build. That is what a green check meant. The 33 SQL suites, the twenty
browser suites and the three native transport suites ran nowhere, and the four
container-backed regressions had either no entry point or no job.

Three jobs are required on a pull request now. `checks` gained the native
transport suites, which had been sitting inside the deployment integration
suite: they own temporary Unix sockets and fork synthetic Node children, need
no manager and no Docker socket, and were picked up by an entry point that
refuses to start without `MANAGER_TEST_TARGET`. They live in
`manager/test/native/` and run through `pnpm test:native`.

`database` is new. Every SQL file gates itself on a task port variable and
skips silently without it, so `manager/test/database/run-all.mjs` names the
nine databases in one table, refuses in words when a variable is unset or is
not a port, connects to all nine before anything runs, and treats one skipped
test as a failure. A Postgres 16 service pinned by digest sits beside the
runner and the nine databases are created through the image's own `createdb`.

`browser` is new. The twenty files under `frontend/test` run through one
script, `pnpm test:browser`, under `node --import tsx` because one of them
reaches the manager's TypeScript through specifiers only tsx rewrites. One
file at a time, each owning its Vite and its Chrome. The job proves the Chrome
binary before it starts, so a missing browser is a failed check and never a
passed one, and it carries `t09_test` for the connected transfer suite.

The manual workflow is four jobs instead of one, so a failure shows by name:
`srs-parser`, `ome-gate`, `image-race` and `integration`. T02 had no entry
point and now has one, `manager/test/docker/srs-check-isolation.sh`, which
puts eight files through the manager's own checker at once and asserts that
each refusal names the directive of its own file and none of the other three.
T01 had none either, and now has
`manager/test/integration/engine-startup-failure.test.ts`.

**The file that separates a parse from a start.** T01 needed a config the
manager's check accepts and the engine dies on. It is the version's own
template with `work_dir /no/such/directory;` added. On the pinned SRS image on
2026-09-10, `srs -t` exited 0 and printed that the file is successful, and
`srs` left the container exited with code 255 one second in, printing that it
could not change directory. SRS reads its config first and changes directory
second, and only the second step touches the file system. Both observations
are in the test's header.

**Verified, 2026-09-10.** Manager unit 2262 of 2262, thirty nine more than
before, from the two new unit files. Common 321, frontend unit 100, native 7,
all with no skips. The whole database directory 518 of 518 with nine
disposable databases, no skips, 161 s in that run. Every browser suite through the new
script, 144 of 144, no skips. Every workspace typecheck clean after building
common, both workflow files valid YAML, `git diff --check` clean against the
branch base, and no em-dash or prose semicolon in anything added. Nothing ran
against the real host, nothing was pushed, and no credential was read.

### What two reviews found in it, and what changed, 2026-09-10

Two parallel reviews on detached worktrees, one for correctness with ten
mutations and one for security with four, plus Fable's own reading. Sixteen
findings, of which two were high.

**A unit test was writing into the real stack checkout.** `portTable.test.ts`
set `SHLS_ROOT` to a temporary root at line 33, but imported a harness at line
29 that reaches `envUtils`, which reads that variable once when it is first
imported. So every run of the manager unit suite deployed into
`manager/swarm-hls-stream` and left a `.env.plain` there, 3088 bytes, the real
stack `.env` merged with the generated lines, mode 0600. Nothing failed
because the CI job checks out no submodule. The import is dynamic now, the
test asserts the file lands in its own root, and the whole unit run goes
through `manager/test/unit/run.mjs`, which hands the suite a throwaway
checkout so no test can reach the real one whatever it imports.

**The SQL runner refused the wrong thing.** It refused a skipped test, but
node counts skipped tests and all 33 files skip at the suite level, which
registers no test at all. A run with every variable unset printed 0 tests, 0
failed, 0 skipped and was called a pass. So did a glob that matched no file.
The rules that catch both, and the summary reading they sit beside, now live
in one module the browser runner uses too, and the SQL runner also reads every
file's gate before it starts anything and refuses one gated on a database this
run does not create.

Also changed: the SRS image was pinned to a digest no tag points at any more,
and is now the one `ossrs/srs:6` resolves to, with both T01 observations taken
again on it. The browser job got a runner of its own with the same rules and a
Chrome preflight. Three browser suites wrote evidence to a fixed
`/private/tmp` path that an ordinary user on a Linux runner cannot create, so
three of fourteen Chrome suites would have failed on the job's first run. The
OvenMediaEngine gate waits for its publisher's ffmpeg install before the
playlist clock starts, and passed here in 120 s. Two load-sensitive unit cases
now wait on what they watch instead of on a 30 ms timer. The SQL preflight
refuses a task database that already holds the manager's own tables. The
Postgres services publish on loopback, the T02 image override has to be a
digest, its scratch directory is removed on any exit path, and the engine log
tail the T01 test prints is redacted.

**Verified again after the fixes, 2026-09-10.** Manager unit 2301 of 2301
twice in a row, common 321, frontend unit 100, native 7 with `DATABASE_URL`
unset, all with no skips. The database directory 518 of 518 in 182 s. Every
browser suite through its runner, 156 of 156 in 351 s, and with
`T09_TEST_PG_PORT` unset the same run ends `REFUSED` on three skipped cases,
exit 1. The three Docker harnesses pass here: T02 in 2 s on the corrected pin,
T03 in 120 s, T05a in 143 s. Every workspace typecheck clean, both workflows
valid YAML, `git diff --check` clean, and `manager/swarm-hls-stream` untouched
after a full unit run.

**Open for Levi.** The workflow costs about 23 Actions minutes a push and the
browser job is more than half of it, so whether it stays required on every
push is a spend decision that is his. Nothing in the repository reads the
workflow files, so a CODEOWNERS entry over `.github/workflows/` with required
code-owner review is the control that would, and both the entry and the
setting are his.

**What did not run and what it costs.** No job in either workflow has run on a
GitHub runner. The T01 startup-failure file needs the whole stack deployed on
one, so its first execution is Levi's dispatch. The SQL suites now run one file
at a time, because two of four parallel runs failed here on tests that read the
clock while another connection holds a lock, which costs 235 seconds a run,
the longest of the six full runs measured. The OvenMediaEngine gate failed here for a reason that is about this
laptop's network: its publisher spends 93 seconds installing ffmpeg inside a
40 second playlist budget, and with the budget raised the gate passed. The
harness was not changed. The T05a qualification on Docker Engine 29.1.3 with
Compose 5.1.4 is still a separate obligation that neither the runner's versions
nor this laptop's discharge. All of it is in `docs/ci.md`, with an estimate of
about 25 Actions minutes a push.

**Merged, 2026-09-10, the T20 completion slice.** Merged into
`feat/ai-remediation` as ab8776c after two parallel reviews, a fix round, a
targeted re-review and a final round (the record is
`../consensus/T20-COMPLETION-FIXES.md`). Verified by Fable at e857994: the
manager unit suite 2317 of 2317 three times through its new runner, the
database directory 518 of 518 through its runner with no skips, the browser
suites 166 of 166 through theirs, the native suites 7, common 321, frontend
unit 100, the three Docker harnesses passing on this laptop (T02 in 3 s on the
digest `ossrs/srs:6` resolves to today, T03 in 130 s with the ffmpeg wait,
T05a in 110 s), both workflows valid YAML, every typecheck clean, prose clean,
no submodule or lockfile movement, and no by-product under the submodule after
the unit runs. Nothing in either workflow has run on a GitHub runner yet: the
checks workflow runs on the next push of this branch, the Docker-backed one is
Levi's dispatch. Two decisions are his: the Actions cost of about 25 minutes a
push with all three jobs required, and a CODEOWNERS entry over
`.github/workflows` with code-owner review in branch protection.

## The documentation says what the code does, T21, 2026-09-10

A prose-only slice on `docs/t21-reconciliation`, cut from `feat/ai-remediation`
at `6dc33d1`. No code, test, workflow or lockfile was touched. The brief is
`../consensus/T21-COMPLETION-BRIEF.md`. Every sentence describing behaviour was
checked against the code on that commit before it stayed, and every sentence
about status now names the branch, the date and the commit it is true at.

**What was wrong, by weight.** Three pages carried a status header naming a
local `main-v2` integration checkpoint from 2026-09-09 as the place this work
lives. It lives on `feat/ai-remediation`, pull request #40. The stack versions
page still described the bundled version as a package sealed on a laptop and
shipped to the host, a path the bundled-on-host slice deleted, and had no
section at all for the settings page or for the Apply build. The root README
said the submodule tracks `main`, that images are built from a pinned commit of
it, and gave two submodule commands that name the submodule instead of its
path, so neither would have matched anything. The manager README said Update is
refused for the bundled version when Update on bundled is precisely how that
version is rebuilt. The T09 API page said the direct locator does not supply
the ownership proof, so admissions on a real database fail closed, which the
owned transport factory closed. Eight further sentences across the testing
pages named work as still to come that the sections beneath them describe as
done, and the T18 evidence paths pointed at a scratch directory that no longer
exists at that prefix.

**What was kept.** The dated checkpoint paragraphs are the record and they
stay. Where one had gone stale it was dated to its own checkpoint rather than
deleted, the way the continuation files do it, and the current state was added
on top. No history was manufactured for a gap.

**Two investigations, both recorded here as the brief asked.** Neither
`STATE.md` nor `CONTEXT.md` exists at the repository root or anywhere else in
the tree, `git log --diff-filter=D` records no deletion of either, and the only
two files that name them as something to read, `AGENTS.md` and
`docs/agents/domain.md`, describe the convention rather than asserting the
files are there, and the consensus records that mention them only record this
same investigation, so nothing was created and nothing is flagged.
(Revisited on 2026-09-16 and settled the other way. `AGENTS.md` did assert both
paths, and `docs/agents/domain.md` printed a file tree containing them, so a
session reading either was told they exist. The three pages under `docs/agents/`
were deleted and `AGENTS.md` rewritten to say what this repository has.)
`docs/consensus/issues/` holds one file per agreed row, 25 of them, T01 through
T22 with T01a and the a/b splits among them, plus its README, and the README's
order section names all 25.

**One thing the older sections say that is no longer true.** "Preserved local
state" above lists three review worktrees outside the repository and says the
original task worktrees remain. None of those paths exists on this machine any
more, and neither do the 22 task branches, checked on 2026-09-10. That section
is left as the record of the day it was written. What actually preserves the
work is the git history: every frozen head is reachable through its merge
commit and named in the merge manifest. The section's own closing rule still
holds, which is to verify any retained resource by its exact recorded identity
before using it, and that check now answers no for those trees.

**One thing a document cannot fix.** `.github/workflows/checks.yml` carries a
comment saying "The twenty-two suites under frontend/test". There are 23, and
`docs/ci.md` says 23, which is the correct number. The same count is ambiguous
in the T20 section above, which says twenty. Twenty sit directly in
`frontend/test`, three more under `frontend/test/support`, and the runner takes
all 23. Changing a workflow file was out of scope for this slice, so the
comment is left as it is and recorded here for whoever next touches that file.

**Verified.** `git diff --check` clean against the branch base, no em-dash and
no prose semicolon in any changed file, and every relative path in every
changed document resolved from that document's own directory. Nothing ran
against the host, nothing was pushed, and no credential or `.env` was read.

**Merged, 2026-09-10, the T21 reconciliation slice.** Merged into
`feat/ai-remediation` as 47b6a6c. One review pass on a detached worktree
checked every changed sentence against the code and found one high finding
(the transaction contracts record still said every journal update advances
the revision, which the T09 slice changed for an unchanged observation), three
medium (an overclaim about a corrupt bundled pin, nine browser suites where
eight drive a browser, and three older feature pages naming branches that no
longer exist with a decision numbering of their own) and six low, all taken
in a correction round (b76fb6a to bb4021c). The first run of the three-job
checks workflow on 6dc33d1 ended with the checks and database jobs green and
the browser job cancelled at its 30 minute limit by a teardown fault on Linux,
which is fixed on its own branch next.

**Merged, 2026-09-10, the browser teardown fix.** Merged into
`feat/ai-remediation` as dc733f4 from the branch `fix/browser-teardown-linux`
(12 commits, 6dc33d1 to d92c413). The Chrome fixture ends Chrome by its
process group and waits its profile out, every fixture teardown runs all of
its steps, the forked connected fixture ends itself when its parent is gone,
and the browser runner bounds each suite file at 600 seconds and judges the
files together. Proven on this laptop inside a Linux container (Chromium 152
on Debian bookworm, as a non-root user, the checkout copied in, PostgreSQL in a
second container sharing the network namespace): 183 tests across 25 suite
files, no hook failure, no orphan process, no leftover profile, in 7 minutes
39 seconds. On macOS the same set passed in 377 seconds. The next push of this
branch is the second run of the browser job on a GitHub runner.

**Merged, 2026-09-10, the runner wait fix.** Merged into `feat/ai-remediation`
as ab627ce from `fix/browser-waits-on-runner` (4 commits, 95cc9c9 to 3a6c1b8).
The second runner run of the browser job (34492919531) finished in 6.8 minutes
with one suite failing: its wait read the browser's resource timing list,
capped at 250 entries and full of Vite's per-module requests, and on this
laptop a stale entry had been satisfying the same wait early. Waits now count
completed requests from the moment they start, every browser session caps that
list at ten so the runner's condition is reproduced here, and each suite has a
Vite cache of its own. The full set passed twice on this laptop with no
re-optimization. Measured on the runner: about 12 billed minutes a push for the
three required jobs, recorded in `docs/ci.md`.

**Merged, 2026-09-11, the browser suites under throttle.** Merged into
`feat/ai-remediation` as 0c02ed0 from `fix/browser-suites-under-throttle`
(17 commits, f9ce5f8 to aa64a43). The third runner run of the browser job
(34498885341) failed one suite on a page read made before the body existed.
The harness now has `BROWSER_CPU_THROTTLE`, every page read and click in the
fourteen Chrome suites is a named wait through four shared helpers, and two
more races surfaced under throttle and are fixed. Qualified on this laptop:
three consecutive green full runs at four times throttle (208 tests, 27 files,
544, 473 and 424 seconds), one at six times, and an unthrottled run in 360
seconds. Recorded as a P2 follow-up under the estate's review-priority rule of
2026-09-11: a failing suite exits late because five suites close their Vite
before their Chrome, which costs ten runner minutes only when a suite fails.

**Ruled, 2026-09-11, the three open questions on the checks.** Levi kept all
three jobs of `checks.yml` required, at the runner-measured cost of about 12
billed minutes a push, rather than moving the browser job to a schedule and
letting a pull request go green with the Chrome suites unrun. He also took the
code-owner guard, so `.github/CODEOWNERS` now names him over `/.github/`, and
the branch protection toggle that makes it binding, "Require review from Code
Owners" on `main-v2`, is his to flip alongside the required-checks flip after
the first green run. The 113 screenshot evidence directories left in the
machine's temp folder by earlier runs were deleted.


**Merged, 2026-09-11, what the fourth runner run found.** Two faults, and one
of them was mine. The Docker-backed workflow had been rejected by GitHub since
the day it was written, because it read `${{ runner.temp }}` in a job-level
`env:` block where that context does not exist, so every push left a red
startup-failure run and the first manual dispatch would have refused to start.
Both paths are written from a step now, and the repository secret the
integration job signs in with exists, generated in 1Password and stored as
`solarpunk-streaming-infra-manager-itest` in the SolarPunk vault, with
`manager/test/integration/env.example` naming it so the local run and the CI
run use one pair.

The fourth browser failure was the pool-draft suite's own, and the first
reading of it here was wrong. It looked like a product fault: a wizard opened
before the versions list arrives keeps an empty stack version and a Continue
that never enables. It is deliberate. `BasicsStep` renders the picker when
`versionChoiceShown(context) || !version`, so the picker is there exactly when
the choice has not been made for the operator, and `version-approval.test.mjs`
says so in words, "a late sole default must leave a way to choose it". The
page the suite timed out on carried that picker and the sentence "Pick a stack
version". Adopting the default silently hid the picker and failed that
assertion, which is how the mistake was caught, and the change is reverted.
The suite now takes every Continue out of Basics through
`continueFromBasics`, which picks the fixture version when the picker is
offered and does nothing when it is not, so either order of arrival passes.

Two things are worth keeping from the round. A container held to two cores
with the runner's own Chrome build reproduces these races for free, at about
one run in three here, which is how this one was found without another billed
run. And a click that times out now says whether the last read saw no element
or a disabled one, which is the difference between looking at the page and
looking at the control, and was the whole of the diagnosis.

Recorded as a P3 limit under the review-priority rule, with its reproduction:
`initialWizardState` reads every context-derived default once, at open, so a
wizard opened before the profiles, groups or host configuration arrive starts
with no feed stream picked, no pool picked, and a generated passphrase rather
than the host-wide one. Each degrades to a usable alternative on the step in
front of the operator, and the passphrase one fails to the encrypted side. To
see any of them, hold the matching request in a fixture and open the wizard
before releasing it, as `pool-draft-browser.test.mjs` does for the pool.

## Private execution copies, 2026-09-11

Merged into `feat/ai-remediation` on 2026-09-11. The brief is `../consensus/EXACT-EXECUTION-BRIEF.md` and it holds the design and the two points it settled.

**What was wrong.** A deploy ran the stack's scripts with the version's build directory as its working directory, and wrote into it. `ensureStackDefaults` bootstrapped `.env` and `deploy/config.json` there, `writeProfileEnv` put `.env.<profile>` there, and the stack's own scripts added `engines/<engine>/.env.<profile>` and `deploy/.env.deploy.<profile>` under the same root. Three things followed. A build stopped being the bytes it was published as, so every artifact digest taken at publication was void after the first deploy from it. Two deployments of one build shared one mutable tree and left their env files beside each other. And nothing could say afterwards which bytes a launched job had actually run.

**What it does now.** Between the port reservation and the first write, a deploy registers an execution root against the job reference its claim already holds, copies the build into `<STACK_VERSIONS_ROOT>/.executions/<execution-id>/tree`, and takes its paths from the copy. The copy is exact, verified against the source before, during and after, and its directories are owner only. Stop, health and remove follow the same copy, because the compose files, the scripts and the deployment's env file are all there now. A version that keeps no immutable builds gets no copy and runs where it always did.

**Retention, which is D11.** A deployment keeps the copy it runs from and the one before it, so a deploy that fails leaves the tree that last worked in place. A deploy that comes up takes the previous one. Anything older goes as soon as a new deploy launches, which is what stops repeated failures growing the disk, and a removed deployment keeps none. Retiring a copy releases its hold on its build, so the build becomes prunable. The state a launched copy sits in had no way out before this, so the authority for leaving it is one predicate in the database: the copy's own job has finished and the deployment has moved on, which is a newer launched copy, a profile that is gone, or one on a different instance. Anything uncertain keeps the copy and the hold.

**Recovery.** A copy whose deploy never spawned anything goes with that deploy. At boot, every copy that never reached ready is taken back, before the prune so the holds it releases are gone by then, and a copy a job may have spawned under is left exactly as it is.

**Two guards that could never fire now can.** `buildJobClaim.ts` refuses to cancel a job whose execution may have launched, and the version-removal and config-operation guards read the same table. Nothing had ever inserted a row into it.

**Two defects found while proving it.** A row comparison sent a timestamp back to PostgreSQL as a parameter, and the column keeps microseconds where a JavaScript Date keeps milliseconds, so a row compared as newer than itself and every launched copy looked replaced. It is fixed by keeping the comparison inside the database. Separately, a chequebook case asserted that a receipt check time strictly advanced between two calls that can land in the same millisecond. It passed alone and failed under the load the new cases added to the parallel database run, which is load the runner has too. It now takes a two millisecond gap.

**Verified.** Manager unit 2354 cases, the whole `manager/test/database` directory 524 cases against nine disposable databases, the shared package 321, the frontend unit suites 100, the native transport suites 7, every typecheck clean, none skipped. Both mutations were checked: running from the build instead of the copy fails the copy case, and dropping the launch record fails four. On a laptop, against a disposable PostgreSQL.

**Not in this slice, and named so it is not mistaken for done.** T01's atomic begin and revert, the creator receipt and the release of operation holds. The full-daemon mount observation is still unused: it attributes a container to a copy by its compose working directory, which only holds for a local target, because `deploy.sh` rsyncs the tree to a remote base before running compose there. Retirement is authorised by the replacing deploy's own success instead, which holds for both. And a build already deployed from before this change still carries the files those deploys left, which the first copy of it copies too. They are inert and no new writes reach a build.

**Retention correction, 2026-09-19, at `a5b4253` plus the execution-retention fix.** The earlier success rule was unsafe for a partial deploy. An uploader-only success created a new execution for the uploader, while the untouched SRS or OME container kept bind mounts into the previous execution. The success hook then retired and deleted that previous root. A later engine restart could no longer read its entrypoint or healthcheck.

Local launched-root cleanup now runs only after a complete all-container mount inventory proves that the candidate is not mounted. Missing or malformed mount data, an unstable container list, a changed daemon, an unregistered execution path and an unavailable reader all retain the roots. An open or blocked deploy attempt also retains them under the daemon's admission lock. An interrupted cleanup left in `deleting` passes through the same mount veto at boot. Once every mount has moved and the durable job and supersession checks still hold, cleanup proceeds and releases the build hold.

The inventory sees the manager API too. Its administrative versions-root mount and `/` mount reach every execution but do not make it a consumer of every deployment. The narrow exception requires a Compose `api` container outside `.executions` with both exact administrative mount pairs from `manager/docker-compose.yml`. An exact execution bind on that container still retains the root. Any other container's parent bind also retains every execution reachable beneath it. Fixtures cover both the real manager mount shape and an unlabelled foreign parent bind.

Remote deployments remain conservative. Their remote rsync paths cannot be matched to the manager's local execution paths without an explicit path mapping. Their launched roots are retained, which preserves safety and can grow local disk use.

## A walkthrough of the whole interface, 2026-09-11

Levi asked for an end to end pass over everything the manager offers, through a browser, and for what it turned up to be fixed.

**How it was run.** A real manager process against a disposable PostgreSQL in a container, on a port of its own, with its stack root a copy of the bundled tree and its versions and data roots temporary directories. The frontend dev server against that manager, and Chrome driving the pages. Nothing touched the deploy host and nothing was funded, so every path that ends at a Bee node ends at a node that is not there.

**What it covered.** Sign in, refused and accepted. A stream deployment through the wizard, its name refused and accepted. A real deploy against the laptop's Docker: it pulled `ethersphere/bee:2.8.2`, created the project's network, volume and containers, started SRS, and failed binding the Bee node's port, because the stack's config names a host address this machine does not have. That failed state on the deployment page, then an edit, a redeploy, a retry, and a blocked attempt released by typing its job id. Engine settings, with a negative segment length refused. The config file editor: a missing placeholder marked, a refused apply, and an accepted one that recreated SRS and watched it for twenty seconds. Stop. Remove, which took the containers, the volume, the network and the data directory with it. The deployments list with its search and its empty result, Transfers, Host with the local target re-verified, Versions, the settings page of a version that has none yet, and Access, where a user was added, refused for a password holding its username, and removed. A non-admin session, which loses the add and remove controls and keeps its own sign-out. Both themes. The viewer and pool wizards as far as their review step.

**Three fixes, each with the browser suite that catches its return.** A deployment page with one container record was 723 pixels wide in a 523 pixel viewport, because the container table has no scroll box of its own, so the whole page slid sideways. Three other places did the same: the postage stamp table, the engine card's row of controls, and the top bar. Each now scrolls, wraps or gives way inside its own width, and `frontend/test/deployment-layout.test.mjs` measures the page at 390, 723 and 1280. That suite also holds the second fix: a first deploy's image pull left 135 lines in the failure card with the line that says what failed at the bottom of them, 2412 pixels of page pushing everything else down. The card now scrolls inside 260 pixels and opens at its last line. The third is in the config file dialog, where a refused apply rendered the manager's reason 450 pixels below the visible area and the button looked like it had done nothing. It scrolls into view, and `frontend/test/engine-config-refusal.test.mjs` measures that it is inside the dialog after a 409.

**Two Levi ruled on the same day, both now fixed.**

*An applied config file leaves a deployment that cannot be removed.* Proven end to end: apply a config file, then press Remove, and the manager refuses with "An unresolved rollback or creation hold must be resolved before cleanup." The rollout finishes `applied` with its `finished_at` set, but the `operation` hold it took on `build_references` is never resolved, and `hasRemovalHold` counts it for ever. Resolving that one row by hand let the removal run to completion at once, which is the whole of the diagnosis. The obvious fix is refused by an existing guarantee: `engineConfigRecoveryHold.test.ts` asserts, for every state including the four terminal ones, that the manager "does not infer safe hold release from the label alone". That is a deliberate rule from the T01 work and the release it points at was never built, so the two together leave the operator with no way out and no page that offers one. Levi ruled that a rollout which has ended lets go of its hold, and that is what it does now: the four terminal states and a supersede release it, `interrupted` keeps it because its recovery still deploys from that build, and so does the saved source an explicit restore keeps reaching for, which `engineConfigExplicitRestore.test.ts` pins. The guarantee that a label alone is never enough now covers the three states that have not ended.

*A redeploy that recreates no container leaves a blocked attempt.* An attempt resolves only when every service it touched shows a container id that did not exist before it started. `docker compose up -d --build` recreates a container only when its image or its config changed, so a retry that changes nothing, or a redeploy after an edit the containers do not see, ends blocked and refuses the next deploy until a person types its job id. Reproduced twice: a redeploy after a notes-only edit, and a plain Retry. The guard's premise, that Compose creates every container after every build, holds for a service built from source and not for one on a fixed image, which is what a stream's SRS and Bee node both are. Levi ruled for the second reading: a deploy that finished cleanly and left a container where it was accounts for that service, because Compose reports nothing to do only once its build is over and a container nothing rebuilt cannot carry another project's image. A script that failed, and a boot judging what a gone manager left, still need a new container.

**One thing recorded and left.** The Versions page counts a version's deployments from a list it fetches once, so a version that gains or loses a deployment while the page is open keeps the old number until Refresh is pressed. The count is informational and the server refuses a removal on its own reading, so nothing turns on it. P3 under the review-priority rule.

**What a laptop cannot reach, and so is not covered here.** The private execution copies, because the bundled version on a developer machine is a legacy tree and legacy versions get no copy by design. The version settings editor, which appears once a version has been built on the host. Everything past the port bind in a deploy, and every path that reads a funded Bee node: balances, the chequebook, buying a stamp, and the uploader that waits for one.

## The first deploy and migration on the live host, 2026-09-11

Levi authorised the deploy, the one-way migration and a full pass on 157.90.34.105 while he was at the keyboard. The runbook is `../consensus/FIRST-DEPLOY-SESSION.md` and this is what happened against it.

**The migration.** `bash deploy/deploy.sh 157.90.34.105` from the branch. Migrations 013 to 031 applied in one run, nineteen of them, one way as D08 decided. The five deployments already there kept running untouched throughout and were all still RUNNING with their containers at the end. The bundled version moved from the flat tree to immutable builds: the host fetched and built the pinned commit 9f1255b itself in twenty nine seconds, and the versions root gained `bundled.repo`, `bundled.builds/9f1255b` and `.executions` beside the existing `main-v3`. The Versions page then said, correctly, that bundled was not tested since that update, and repeated it on the wizard's version picker.

**The version settings page ran for the first time anywhere.** Revision 3 on build 9f1255b, state applied, the host's own carried-over keys present with Remove beside each, the generated secrets masked behind Reveal, `deploy/config.json` and both engine environments below. `main-v3` keeps its Settings disabled because it is still a flat checkout, which is the rule the page states.

**Execution copies ran for the first time anywhere, and the run found what was wrong with them.** A test deployment on the rebuilt bundled version came up on slot 6. The log shows what the slice promised: the build copied to `.executions/<id>/tree`, the profile env written into the copy, and the deploy script spawned from the copy. The build was never written into. Two more deploys followed, and three findings came out of them.

*The mount observation did not recognise a copy.* It reads the directory a container reports, which is now the copy and not a build, so it recorded no snapshot at all. Nothing then covered the deploy's job hold, the hold stayed open for ever, and with it the copy could never be retired and the build could never be pruned, which is the whole of what the slice was built to manage. Two deploys left two copies and two open holds. The copy's own row is the only thing that can name its build, because the copy is exact and nothing inside it distinguishes the two. Fixed, and `executionMountObservation.test.ts` reproduces it. After that deploy the stuck holds resolved on the next boot, and the deploy after it left one copy live and the other two released with every hold closed, which is D11 working.

*The deploy carried the sessions' own scratch directory to the host.* 1504 of the 3128 files it sent were under `.scratch`, the working notes and evidence logs of the sessions that built this branch, ignored by git and never part of what a host runs. The rsync excludes it now, `managerDeployScript.test.ts` holds that, and the 38 MB already on the host was removed. The next deploy sent fourteen files.

*The whole transfer history had no route in production.* The Transfers page said its response could not be verified, which was honest: nginx had no location for the bare `/chequebook` routes and handed them the SPA's own HTML, so no record could ever be read. The dev server proxies them, so the feature worked on a laptop and had no route at all on a host. This is the second time a path has been proxied in one place and not the other, after the Host page's targets, so the test is now general: every path the dev server proxies must be taken by a location nginx sends to the manager, checked by matching each location's own rule rather than by looking for a name in it.

**What the fixes proved after landing.** Both rulings of the same day hold on the live host. A redeploy that changed only the notes, which is the case that used to leave a blocked attempt and refuse the next deploy, came up running with no blocked attempt at all. Removing the test deployment took its containers, its data directory and all three of its execution copies, and left zero open build holds. The host ended with the five deployments it started with and nothing of the test.

**Not done, and still Levi's.** Nothing was funded and nothing was spent. `review-20260907` holds 5 BZZ in its wallet with an empty chequebook and no stamp, and its earlier fill has no operation record because the table arrived with migration 020 today. The paid part is still T22 and still waits on the D05 numbers.

## The second live pass, and the first money spent, 2026-09-13

Levi asked for everything to be tried. This pass ran against the manager on its
own public domain, `streamtestinfra.swarmens.limo`, rather than through an SSH
tunnel, so it exercised the same front door an operator uses. It found four
defects, two of them in paths no laptop can reach, and it stopped at the one
gate a session must not open by itself.

**What was verified live and is working.** The Transfers page, which had no
route in production until 2026-09-11, reads its record list and reports an empty
history. The Host page shows live per-container figures for eleven containers.
The Versions page and the version settings editor read real data, and main-v3's
Settings stay disabled with the reason a flat checkout gives. User
administration lists both accounts with their sessions. The wizard's own
validation works, name check included. Execution copies are mounted from
`.executions` and are unreadable to the deploy user, which is the 0700 root
ownership doing its job. A cross-origin write was refused by the Origin check,
which a local proxy proved by accident.

**A version that can place nothing said the host was full.** Creating a
deployment on main-v3, the default version that three deployments already run,
was refused with "Every port slot from 1 to 99 is taken, remove a deployment to
free one". The host publishes ports for six slots and no more, so the advice was
wrong and would have cost a working deployment. The cause is a version whose
compose file the manager cannot read: every port then falls back to tcp with no
service against it, no problem is recorded, and the port policy afterwards
refuses every public port whose owning service it cannot name. Running the
product's own rule over its own contracts: bundled passes 99 slots of 99, main-v3
passes none. Fixed at the contract, which now names the port, the rule and the
way out, and says it before the create inventories anything. The Versions page
and the wizard's version picker say it too, so nobody meets it at the end of a
wizard.

**Creating a deployment looks like it failed.** The create call takes over a
minute on the host, and the generic API location in `frontend/nginx.conf` kept
nginx's default sixty second read timeout, so the browser got a 504 while the
manager accepted the work and deployed. The wizard then re-checked the name,
found the deployment that now existed, and said the name is taken. **Fixed**: that
location carries `proxy_read_timeout 300s` now, beside the ones the chequebook
routes already had, and the four deployment action routes stream with no timeout
at all.

**Nothing can be published until the node is funded.** A real SRT feed was sent
at the address the deployment page gives. It reached the media server, which
parsed the stream id correctly and then refused, because SRS asks the uploader
for permission on every publish and the uploader is held down until the node is
funded and stamped. The wizard's last screen said "The OBS URL is ready", which it
was not. **The copy is fixed**: the review step now says the uploader is held back
until the node is funded and a stamp bought, and that the OBS URL is ready after
that. Still open: the manager shows the operator nothing about the refusal
itself.

**The stamp purchase, the first money this project has spent.** Levi funded the
node with 5 BZZ and 0.1 xDAI, and Bee deployed its own chequebook contract
unaided. The first purchase was refused by Bee with a plain 400: a batch must be
good for 24 hours, which at the price of the day meant at least 1,571,927,040
per chunk, and the manager's own estimate had offered 500,000,000 as "7h 58m".
So the manager endorses amounts the node will not accept, and it turned Bee's
clear 400 into a 502 with nothing shown on the page, which reads as a button
that does nothing. Both unfixed and both worth a line of work. The second
attempt at 2,000,000,000 and depth 17 cost 0.0262 BZZ, became usable in about a
minute, and the manager set it on the deployment by itself.

**Where it stopped.** Readiness reached two of five. The remaining gate is the
chequebook, which this version wants filled with half a BZZ before it will start
an uploader. Filling it moves a crypto asset, which is the one class of action a
session does not perform, so it waits for Levi. Ingest, storage and playback
therefore remain unproven, and everything up to them is proven.

## The review rounds on the pinned stack, 2026-09-16

**What this block records.** Three rounds of work on `main-v2` in one day, none of
it deployed to the live host yet. The stack submodule was pinned first at
3a831508 and then at 7e2de6f7, the head that closed the stack's own review, with
the contract reader answering the same sixteen ports at both. Six read-only
review lanes went over the manager code, the compose wiring, the environment
model, the deploy path, the firewall, and the probes and the state machine,
because deploys had been slow, states wrong and concurrent runs had collided on
the host. Every finding carried a priority before anyone worked on it, and the
batch had one rule from Levi: nothing tailored to one host.

**Reads and probes.** A Bee node is read through one cache with a three-second
window and single flight, so a page of tiles no longer fans out one request per
tile per tick. A read that fails says why, timeout, unreachable, refused or
malformed, with the time it took, and a node that cannot be read is shown as
unreadable rather than as stopped. The read log warns once when reads start
failing and once when they recover, with a reminder at most every five minutes
(264879c, 257ba12, 86ea4f8, d937c24).

**The state machine.** Boot judges a deployment the manager was interrupted in
by the containers Docker has for it, instead of writing ERROR over every row it
finds in a transitional state (df0b68a to 143ce6e). A deploy that fails writes
its error only over the row its own claim still owns, and the database suite
caught the first version of that rule retargeting a newer claim's row (c4f7084).
A job's outcome carries the exit code and the signal, and the browser reads both
from the stream's final event.

**The deploy path.** A deployment runs from a copy of the immutable build that is
hard links rather than bytes, with the settings files the build carries copied,
because the deploy script rewrites the copy's `.env` in place and through a link
that write would have moved the build's own digest (ef1cfe2, 4c8921e). Eight
kilobytes of disk per deploy instead of 481 megabytes. The tree is hashed twice
(2f7a50d), and the stack's child processes no longer inherit the manager's own
database and data root variables (314c739).

**Secrets and env files.** The signing private key and the SRT passphrase left
the profile row, replaced by `has_private_key` and `has_srt_passphrase`, with
`GET /profiles/:name/srt-passphrase` answering the passphrase on demand and
logging who read it (fd48b4d, b00f359, 0b32119, 306d3d7, a794871, f1f27de,
3c4df56). Reading a deployment's effective engine config logs its reader too
(aa340c1). The OME admission secret is a required stack secret (db9660b). Env
files are written 0600 (70a27b5), a value with a control character or a newline
is refused before it reaches a file (adeb096), and migrations 033 and 034 add
NOT VALID checks on the feed topic and the Bee URL (6be87a2, adeb096).

**Ports and the firewall.** The three per-rung Bee peer roles left the public
firewall set, because this manager starts no rung service (33ea4e1), RTMP ingest
is labelled internal (c05db86), and a port the deployment page calls public has
to be a band the generator opens (00377b6, 6b9aa90).

**Segment length.** By Levi's decision the manager's own segment length is two
seconds with a fifteen-second playlist window (d15c5e3). A create body may carry
`engine_settings` (cd68e8b), and the wizard pre-fills two seconds for the SRS
engine and sends it (a9a849b).

**Around the code.** The checks workflow checks out the submodule, which four
unit tests read (bd970b2). `AGENTS.md` was rewritten and the three pages under `docs/agents/`
removed (33656e6). Nandor Komlodi's port of the remote-host Bee deploy fixes
(11ff5e4, from master's PR 41) was merged as ecaea40 without a conflict.

**Verified on ecaea40.** Typecheck, common 358, manager 2521, native 7, frontend
186, the frontend build, the database suite 526 of 526 with migrations 032 to
034 applied, and the stack's own deploy suite 883 of 883 at 3a831508 with an
unchanged deploy tree to 7e2de6f7. GitHub's checks are green on bd970b2 and
ecaea40.

**The third round, later the same day, on Levi's five answers.** A group of
streams and an ABR uploader carry the segment length too: `POST /groups` takes
`engine_settings`, writes it to every member and refuses it for a node pool, a
member added later takes its siblings' settings, and the wizard offers the
field to an ABR uploader and sends it for a group (e8dff67, a58b724, 16b4f9d).
Boot judges an interrupted deployment by whether its containers run rather than
by whether they exist: the Docker snapshot carries each container's state from
both readers, a service is up when one of its containers is running, an exited
or restarting container after a manager restart reads as ERROR naming it, and a
finished stop reads as STOPPED (4b223ec, e3a4349, e36b8d2, 386d948). A read-only audit of
every living page and of the comments in the files the day changed found
twenty-one stale statements, three of them P1, two pages still saying the
profile JSON carried the key and the passphrase. Every one is corrected in the
commits from 291b1e4 to 00ae65d: two dated issue records carry the line that
closed them, the README names every feature page, and an unused defaults helper
is gone. The fourteen Dependabot alerts stay as they are on Levi's word.

**Verified on 00ae65d, the code head of the third round.** Typecheck, common 358, manager
2536, native 7, frontend 192, the frontend build, and the database suite 527 of 527 against a
disposable Postgres with the nine task databases, one case more than the second round for the
group repository's new column. The commits after that head change documentation only.

**Deployed to the live host the same evening.** Levi read the host first: after
his wipe and rebuild of 2026-09-15 it ran the manager alone, four containers up
for 21 hours, no deployments, the bundled version built at the stack commit
76318d1a. The first deploy of e364e33 stopped before it touched anything: the
remote-host port had added a bind mount of `manager-ssh/ssh_config` onto
`/etc/ssh/ssh_config`, the fresh host had no such file, Docker created a
root-owned directory at the path and refused to mount a directory onto a file,
so the upgrade container never started, no migration ran and the old manager
kept serving. Levi gave the host an empty file by hand and the second run went
through at 11:15 UTC: migrations 032, 033 and 034 applied, the receipt
completed, the bundled build ready at 7e2de6f7 inside the run. The fix so no
fresh host needs that step: the image links the system-wide ssh config to the
mounted directory, the compose file mounts the directory alone, and
`deploy.sh` creates it as the deploying user, with the tests that hold it.

**Dependabot, Levi's.** Sixty alerts, not fourteen as first reported: twelve
high, thirty-nine medium and nine low, the same advisories counted for three
manifests. Twenty of them were filed against `frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml`, a copy
pnpm never read: a workspace keeps one lockfile at its root, and this one sat
unchanged from 2026-05-19 while the package gained three dependencies. Ruled
the same evening: the alerts stay as they are for now, and the stale lockfile
goes. It went with a test in the manager's unit suite that keeps the root
lockfile the only one. GitHub counts alerts on `master`, the default branch,
which still carries the file, so those twenty close once the deletion reaches
master and not before. Three history collisions among concurrent implementers,
accepted as they stand.
Decided the same evening: the 36 MB of review logs and captures left the
repository's untracked `.scratch`
for an evidence folder outside the repository, with a tombstone
at the old path, so state a rebuild cannot
recreate lives outside the repository.

## The first node pool on the live host, 2026-09-17

**What the host showed.** Levi created `abr-pool-1`, four light Bee nodes, one
per rung, and funded and stamped them by hand, then the ABR uploader
`abr-pool-stage-1`, all on 0696a28. The pool took 8 minutes 21 seconds to
deploy, of which the four deploy scripts took 32 seconds: each member waited
about 117 seconds for its execution copy, which hashes all 43,000 files of the
build twice, once on the source and once on the hard-linked copy, and walks
their stamps four times, one file at a time, while the same hashing with a C
tool inside the api container takes 6 seconds. The uploader's deploy was then
refused: its pool string named every node at `http://157.90.34.105:10015` and
siblings, composed from `PUBLIC_HOST`, while the T06 bind step puts every local
Bee API on the Docker bridge address alone, 10.200.0.1 on that host. Nothing
answered on the public address from the host or from any container, the
manager's own probe had logged that, the wizard read "Publishing is not
verified" for every rung, and the uploader's chequebook gate refused with a
four second timeout that blamed the chequebook. Docker restarted the uploader
until the deploy guard refused the deploy. Separately, every running Bee node
read "Funding not checked" on the lists and sat under "Needs attention",
because lists never fetched balances and the checklist called a reading it
never took a problem.

**Rulings.** D15: the stack's uploader starts whatever its chequebook and
postage readings say, its start gates warn by default and
`UPLOADER_START_GATES=refuse` restores the refusal, and the startup reads get
their own budget, `START_GATE_TIMEOUT_MS`, 20 seconds by default, refined the same morning
into a per-gate mode, `chequebook-warn` by default, under which the postage
gate refuses what the node answered and warns what it could not read
(decision 7 b). D16, amending
D02: the manager starts the uploader even when its node does not answer, the
deployment says the node is not available and the uploader keeps trying. The
execution copy cost is the next task, T23, hash once at publish and verify by
stamps. A Bee node's mode at start, ultra-light or light, with our RPC endpoint
and the gas funding flow, is registered as T27 pending Levi's yes on the
wording. Rows T23 to T27 are under `../consensus/issues/`.

**Built the same night, on main-v2.** T24, the pool string carries the address
a container on this host reaches a local node on, the operator's
`BEE_LOCAL_HOST` or the literal address `host.docker.internal` resolves to
inside the api container, and the probe tests exactly that URL (4817887,
a508f46, 56000a8 after the security review found the resolver remembering a
failed lookup). T26, a list judges funding from the chequebook reading it has
and never calls an unread wallet or stamp a problem, the deployments page
fetches chequebook readings and its filter uses them, pool member rows take the
stamp state from the manager's own pool result, the wizard's pool step shows
what the probe found per rung, the pool card says where its addresses work
(8b665b4, 5c6316a, 2b6feeb, 0eecace, 8cff4fa, 39ae189, f60b93c, 00f9784,
e90ac0b, 0195aee, 394f67c). The stack branch `fix/uploader-start-gates-warn`
carries T25's first phase (f520f4ba, 7aa81ff7, Solar-Punk-Ltd/swarm-hls-stream,
pushed, not merged). Two reviews, one for correctness and one for security,
found no P1 and their P2 items are in those commits or recorded below.

**Verified.** Manager unit 2552, common 360, frontend 239, typecheck and build
clean, on the laptop and in a container job, where the session branch
`fix/first-pool-findings` ran. That container job is red on one thing that
is not this work: `frontend/test/pool-draft-browser.test.mjs` fails there on
every commit, a control at c9af798 included, while GitHub's own browser job
passed that commit and the laptop and the two-core reproduction pass it. A
diagnostic in the test (cabbf13) serves the next run. The stack branch also
passed a full check. GitHub's
checks run on Levi's push of main-v2.

**Built later the same night.** T23, the execution copy: a build's inventory is
recorded once in a sibling file `<buildId>.inventory.json` beside the builds,
later copies prove the build by a stat walk against it (device, inode, mode,
size and modification time, not the status-change time, which every hard link
moves) and a linked copy by inode identity, so the steady state reads no byte
of the build (5933766, 259c660, 98f3afa, 9d1c08e, 7bf650f). Two reviews, one
for correctness and one for security, reproduced two P1 defects in that first
version and one more defect beside them. The first P1: a record outlived the
build it described once that build was pruned, and stranded a reused build id.
The second P1: the record's own file name was read as a build id by the
settings rebuild, which is the manager rebuilding a deployment's stack after an
operator changes its settings. The third defect: a record could list fewer
files than it stamped. All closed in e32ac8a, 4463da8, ee87d0c, 1d095a7,
addfe22, 31784fa, 97d78f6, e08a41f, 2c4d46e, a9fd7b5, 9fd92e0, with a test file
for the record, a refusal that names the record's path, and a tripwire that
every file of the build an engine mounts goes in read-only. Measured on a
synthetic tree of 20,000 files: 18.2 to 18.7 seconds before, 15.1 on the first
copy of a build after, which still hashes it once, and 9.0 on every copy after
that. Not yet measured on the host. T25's second phase, D16, in the stack: the
uploader's API listens first and a node that does not answer is waited for with
a backoff. `/health` says `waiting_for_node` with the node's URL, attempts and
last error, and a warned start gate is latched there as `start_gate_warned`.
Under the warn setting the uploader reads every rung rather than stopping at
the first one that fails. URLs are stripped from the messages and the timeout
has a ceiling (60caae7b to 46c9d120, green in a full check). In the manager: neither
half of its own start gate refuses a node that says nothing,
`GET /profiles/:name/uploader-health` maps the uploader's own health to
one reading, and the deployment page's uploader step says waiting, warned,
unhealthy, healthy or unreachable (4fe7e20, 1b65b22, 4d8db8d, 4d57267, 968de8c,
d4a4e8c, 0772067, fa576d7, 73f347a, 43ec8e8). Manager unit 2596, frontend 249,
common 360, typecheck and builds clean.

**Merged and pinned, 2026-09-17 morning.** The stack branch
`fix/uploader-start-gates-warn` (32 commits on 7e2de6f7, head 55b22bf1) passed
a full check twice, at ad5f27d2 and at its head, was
merged fast-forward into main-v3 on Levi's word and is pinned here in 7b2312f.
Its last seven commits carry decision 7 b: the postage gate refuses a batch the
node answered about and warns one it could not read, the gate messages state
the finding and leave the boot to the runner, the five pages that describe the
mode say so, and a raw NUL byte that had made the postage gate's source binary
to grep since August is written as its escape. A copy of that head merged with
Nandi's open pull requests #235 and #236 typechecks and passes the uploader
suite with a three-hunk resolution in the uploader's `index.ts` and two README
rows, kept for whoever merges second and never posted on his pull request.

**Built in the afternoon, T27 and the manager's own line of the stack.** T27,
a Bee node's mode and its RPC endpoint chosen when the node is created, was
ruled built as scoped and landed in three halves the same day: the common
and manager half (`1c26203` to `1c8fc25`, then the review fixes `9b07e56` to
`b56ae6f`), the frontend half (`08bc01e` to `335b6fb`, then `e1447dc`,
`dd4ced2`, `0361a33`), and the stack half on the stack's `feat/bee-node-mode`
(`75f9b1e1`, `251bb1c1`, `5553652c`), each with its own full check. Three read-only
reviews found two P1 on the manager half, both fixed: a `$` in a stored
address that Compose would expand from the deployment's own env file on a
remote deploy target, and the endpoint URL reaching pages and stored output
through Bee's own log. The brief, the fixes file and the feature page are
`../consensus/T27-NODE-MODE-BRIEF.md`, `../consensus/T27-NODE-MODE-FIXES.md`
and `../features/bee-node-mode.md`. Counts at the end: common 405, manager
unit 2666, manager database 540, frontend unit 311, browser 259, the stack's
deploy suite 907.

Then Levi ruled on Nandi's open pull request #235, whose branch had grown
twelve commits and conflicted with main-v3 in three files: the manager works
on its own line of the stack, `feat/manager-line`, created at the head
main-v3 had that day (55b22bf1) and fast-forwarded to 5553652c with T27's
stack half, and the stack's main-v3 goes back by force push to the commit his
pull request had merged (69470e09), so it merges as before. The resolve and
merge of the two lines into main-v3 come later on his word. The submodule
tracks the new line, the manager pins 5553652c (`5e9643e`), the README and
the versions page say why, and the force push is his command, since the
guard refuses it from a session. An integration branch a session had started
building for that pull request without his word was stopped and discarded.

**Open.** The pin has moved, so the waiting state reaches the host on Levi's
next push of main-v2 and deploy. The three decisions listed here on the night
were answered the same morning: the record refusal stays, recoverable by
removing the named file (64a7fd0), a chequebook balance nothing can parse warns
like every other chequebook reading (d4a4e8c), and lists take a stamp reading
per running node at most every two minutes. The uploader created
before the fix holds the public-host string: copy the pool string from the
pool page again and paste it into its "Node pool string" field under Edit,
then Retry.

**The docs and comment review of the evening, 2026-09-17.** Levi asked for a
staleness and correctness pass over the pages and the code comments of both
lines, the stack's `feat/manager-line` and the manager's `main-v2`, with the
pin moved to whatever the stack's line ended at. Four read-only reviews ran in
parallel, one per repository and kind, each reading whole the files changed
since the last audit and sweeping the rest for the behaviours the week changed:
the uploader boot and its gates, the node mode and the RPC endpoint, the
gateway's chain keys, the branch the pin tracks. Every finding carried the code
line that made it false. The stack's pages: no P1, seven P2, four P3, the two
that mattered being the sentence in `.env.sample` and `deploy/README.md` that
every node is waited for, where only the coordinator is (a rung node that does
not answer is warned about under the shipped mode and the uploader starts
degraded), and the roadmap's flip recipe naming one gateway key where two are
needed. The stack's comments: 27 rows, eight of them P1 by the rule that a
comment contradicting a ruling is P1, none by damage: `index.ts`, `config.ts`,
`StreamCatalog.ts` and its test, `health.test.ts`, `assert-started.sh` and its
test still said a down node refuses the boot, or that only `refuse` lets the
postage gate stop a start, all written before D16, `chequebook-warn` and
decision 7 b. The manager's pages: four P1 (the sample env and the chequebook
page still said the floor refuses an uploader start, overtaken by `667aee5`
the same afternoon), three P2 (the ladder page said the waiting state was not
pinned, the README quick start curled a port compose does not publish, the
deposit and withdraw rows carried the old body) and twelve P3. The manager's
comments: 22 rows, five P1 (the same floor sentence in five files), six P2
(the health service and its test said the pinned stack reports no waiting
state, the `$` note gave the opposite of the address rule, the Dockerfile said
the deploy builds the stack on the host). Everything was accepted and landed
by two Opus lanes, one per tree, one finding per commit: 42 commits on
`feat/manager-line` (head `52164ebf`, uploader 1571 and deploy 908 green, a
full check passed) and 34 on `main-v2` before the pin (common 405, manager unit
2667, frontend unit 311, typecheck green, a full check passed at the
pin commit `d54b1c9`), plus one test each: the deploy
suite now holds the uploader README's environment tables in step with
`config.ts`, and `managerEnvKeyDocs.test.ts` holds every env key the manager
reads to a line in the sample or the README, which is how `MANAGER_HOST`,
`HOST_PROC` and `HOST_ROOTFS` were found undocumented. The pin moved to
`52164ebf` in `d54b1c9`.

**Open from the review.** Two code observations, not fixed because the pass
was words only: a bee-uploader's container snapshot never carries the resolved
`RPC_ENDPOINT` or the gateway's two keys (`buildEffectiveEnv` does not set
them, `writeProfileEnv` does), recorded as a P3 limit in the T27 fixes file and
called real by the comment reviewer, and `pnpm stack:start` in
`manager/package.json` passes a compose profile named `full` that the compose
file does not declare, so the flag does nothing. Two stack comments the
reviewer could not prove either way are left as they are: the SRS retry window
"60s" in `config.ts`, and the text shape a wrapped 5xx arrives in, which
`NodeWait.ts` matches on. And one P2 the stack lane measured rather than read,
recorded on the T25 row (`e9f1d56`) and not built: a feed head read whose
transfer breaks, on a node that then fails the liveness check, is rethrown
with the transport code where the wait's classifier does not look, so the
boot ends once and docker restarts it where D16 wants a wait. Levi took the
fix the same night: `b3d8c1ad`, `8a9eaf66` and `66ed0d4a` on `feat/manager-line`,
the classifier reading the transport code from `statusText` where bee-js puts
it, the T25 row has the detail.
