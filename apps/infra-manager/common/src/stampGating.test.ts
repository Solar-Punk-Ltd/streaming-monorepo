/**
 * beeTargetProblem: is a profile's upload destination coherent?
 *
 * These rules used to live only as per-field yup tests on
 * `createProfileSchema`, where they could see only the fields in the request
 * body. `PUT /profiles/:name` carries neither `kind` nor `components`, so all
 * three passed silently on update. Stating them over a whole profile is what
 * lets one definition serve both paths.
